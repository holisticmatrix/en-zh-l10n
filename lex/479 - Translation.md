## 第一台电脑 - First computer

**Lex Fridman:** 跟我讲讲你的第一台电脑吧。还记得吗？  
Tell me about your first computer. Do you remember?

**Dave Plummer:** 记得特别清楚。虽然很久后才真正拥有自己的电脑，但第一次接触是台TRS-80 Model 1基础版，4K内存。那时我大概十一岁，读五六年级，经常骑车去当地的RadioShack商店。店里除了音响设备，有次堆着几个标着"电脑"的箱子。我问店员，他们说刚进货还没拆封。我当时胆子挺大，就说"要不我帮你们组装？"他们居然答应了："行啊，你试试看。"  
I do. I didn't own my first computer for a long time, but the first computer I ever used was a TRS-80 Model 1, Level 1, 4K machine, and I rode my bike in fifth or sixth grade, so I was about 11, to the local RadioShack. They had the standard component stereo systems, everything else RadioShack had, but they had a stack of boxes that was labeled "computer." So I was asking the people who worked there about it, and they said they just got it and they hadn't set it up yet. I was rather precocious and I figured, "Well, I'll set it up for you," and they said, "Okay. Have a shot."

**Lex Fridman:** 当时知道怎么组装吗？  
Did you know what you were doing?

**Dave Plummer:** 完全不懂。不过想着应该比组合音响复杂不到哪去。麻烦的是坦迪公司把电源、视频、磁带接口都做成了相同的五针DIN口，插错了会烧机器。我对照标签装好后开始瞎鼓捣，因为对电脑一窍不通，就试着输入英文命令——像PRINT 2+2这种能运行，但对基础解释器输入更复杂的英语就没用了。  
**Dave Plummer:** Absolutely not. I mean, it's no worse than a component stereo. The only thing is that Tandy, in their infinite wisdom, used the same five-pin DIN connector for power, video, and I think cassette, so they were all identical, and if you plugged them in wrong, you'd blow it up. So I read the label and got it working and wound up playing with it and not knowing anything about computers. So I'm typing English commands into it and, you know, PRINT 2+2 works perfectly, yet more simple English that you enter into a basic Level 1 interpreter is not going to get you very far.

**Lex Fridman:** 所以你在试着用英语和电脑对话？  
So you're trying to talk to it in English?

**Dave Plummer:** 那时候只能这样。我六年级在作文纸上写的程序现在还留着，那程序逻辑看似通顺，但根本不可能在当时任何解释器上运行。后来我每周四六都骑车去店里，他们很包容地让我用电脑。  
**Dave Plummer:** Didn't know any better. And I still have an old foolscap that I wrote in sixth grade of a program that's kind of illogically correct but has no chance of working on any interpreter that existed at the time, so it took me a while to figure out what was actually going on with them. But I rode my bike down there every Thursday and Saturday, and they were gracious to let me use the machine.

**Lex Fridman:** 具体是哪年？  
When was this?

**Dave Plummer:** 79到80年左右。  
**Dave Plummer:** '79, '80.

**Lex Fridman:** 那时候电脑发展到什么水平了？  
Okay. What was the state of the art of computing back then? So what are we talking about?

**Dave Plummer:** 三大主流机型刚问世：TRS-80 Model 1、PET 2001和苹果II差不多同期出现。  
**Dave Plummer:** Well, the big three had come out. There was the TRS-80 Model 1, there was the PET 2001, and the Apple II came out roughly simultaneously.

**Lex Fridman:** 苹果II算得上最伟大的电脑吗？  
Apple II. Would you say that's the greatest computer ever built?

**Dave Plummer:** 事后看也许吧。不过我个人更倾向Commodore 64。  
**Dave Plummer:** Probably in retrospect. Well, I would probably give that to the Commodore 64.

**Lex Fridman:** 咱俩看法一致！那也是我的第一台电脑，虽然是在它发布多年后才用的。Commodore 64确实惊艳，不过苹果II对个人电脑历史影响更大。  
**Lex Fridman:** Yeah. You and I agree on this, that that was my first computer probably many years after it was released, but yeah, Commodore 64's incredible. But yes, Apple II had a huge impact on the history of personal computers.

**Dave Plummer:** 长远影响难量化，但我觉得64可能影响了更多人。  
**Dave Plummer:** Right. It's hard to gauge the long-term impact, but I think the 64 itself probably influenced more people, so that's my reason for picking that one.

**Lex Fridman:** 销量更高？  
**Lex Fridman:** You think so? The sales were certainly higher.

**Dave Plummer:** 对，数字惊人。不同统计口径都显示销量非常高。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah. I mean, the numbers are hard to believe. It depends which numbers you believe, but even the medium estimates were pretty high.

**Lex Fridman:** 后来你也用上Commodore 64了？聊聊在那台机器上做什么吧。  
All right, cool. So you eventually graduated to the Commodore 64. Tell me about that machine. What did you do on the Commodore 64?

**Dave Plummer:** 首秀就把软驱烧了——因为是从电脑小店买的二手货，坏了得寄回德国修。我只能用磁带录音机存储程序，靠着机器语言监视器，用十六进制输入6502操作码写基础程序。  
**Dave Plummer:** Well, the first thing I did was overheat the floppy drive on it, which was unfortunate because it wasn't a warranty machine. My parents didn't have a lot of money so we bought it from Computer House as opposed to one of the major retailers, which meant when it died, it had to go back to Germany or something to be fixed. So I was left with no floppy and so I had a cassette deck, which was the best you could do at the time, and so I was writing small things, and I had a machine language monitor that you could load from cassette. It didn't have an assembler built in, but it had a disassembler, so you could enter the op codes in 6502 in hex, and if you were careful about planning, you'd be able to write some basic programs.

**Dave Plummer:** 我第一个作品是《Galaga》的克隆版。虽然粗糙但有敌机攻击功能，全是手写机器语言。6502代码不能重定位，要在中间加代码得手动跳转，简直像意大利面条一样混乱。最后居然能运行了，我想备份时却把空白盘内容复制到了数据盘上——这就是我的数据管理初体验。  
**Dave Plummer:** So that's kind of how I learned, and the first thing I ever wrote on it was a clone of Galaga. Now, it's a bad clone of Galaga, but it has the major enemies that attack over time, and it's all written in hand-coded machine language, and you can't relocate 6502, so if you need to add code in the middle, you need to manually sort of jump to somewhere else, do your work, jump back to where you were. It's just hideous spaghetti code. But it all worked eventually, and I went to make a backup of it to preserve it for future scholars or whatever the hell I was doing. And I copied my blank floppy onto my data floppy. So that was my first experience with data management.

**Lex Fridman:** 哦不……  
**Lex Fridman:** Oh, no.

**Dave Plummer:** 所以我的第一个程序就这么没了。  
**Dave Plummer:** So I don't have a copy of my first program anymore.

**Lex Fridman:** 当时什么感觉？记得那种……恕我直言，干了件蠢事的心情吗？这也是编程经历的一部分。  
**Lex Fridman:** What was that feeling like? Do you remember, of, of just doing something if I may say so, like stupid, you know? Which is a part of the programming experience.

**Dave Plummer:** 充满负罪感。因为一时疏忽或错误决定，几周的心血就没了。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah, there was a huge amount of guilt because, right, you destroyed several weeks- … of work and you know it was because you rushed- or you did something stupid or you made an unwise choice.

**Lex Fridman:** 那个游戏的编程有什么特别之处？  
**Lex Fridman:** What can you tell me about the programming involved in that game?

**Dave Plummer:** 是纯粹的机器语言。  
**Dave Plummer:** So it's literally machine language.

**Lex Fridman:** 连汇编都不是？  
**Lex Fridman:** So machine… So it's not- … even assembly.

**Dave Plummer:** 当时没有汇编器，我本应该先写个汇编器，但没那么聪明。  
**Dave Plummer:** Not assembly yet because there was no assembler built in, so I should have written an assembler as my first task, but I wasn't that clever.

**Lex Fridman:** 写汇编器难吗？  
**Lex Fridman:** How hard is that to do?

**Dave Plummer:** 很简单，就像学C语言语法一样，一旦掌握就忘不掉。  
**Dave Plummer:** Trivial, and it's one of those things that sticks, I think. You do it so many times. You know, if I give you a C issue, there are certain syntactic issues in C that you're never going to forget and get wrong. And it's just one of those.

**Lex Fridman:** 用机器码编程有什么局限？  
**Lex Fridman:** Like, what are the limitations of programming in machine code, as a programmer?

**Dave Plummer:** 必须完全顺序编写，像在磁带上编程一样只能往后添加。  
**Dave Plummer:** The biggest issue is you have to write completely sequentially because at least in that variant, 6502, you can't add things later. You can only add things on the end. So it's like programming a tape in a way.

**Lex Fridman:** 你用机器语言做过最复杂的东西是什么？  
**Lex Fridman:** What was the most complicated thing you've built with machine language?

**Dave Plummer:** 就是那个游戏了。用汇编做过更复杂的，但纯机器语言只做过这个。  
**Dave Plummer:** That game would be. I mean, in assembly language, I've done a fair bit of complicated stuff, but in actual machine language, I think that game would be the only thing I've actually-

**Lex Fridman:** 你确实做出了个游戏。  
**Lex Fridman:** You literally built a game.

**Dave Plummer:** 不算出色，但能玩。  
**Dave Plummer:** Not a great game, but it worked.

**Lex Fridman:** 然后你把它抹掉了？  
**Lex Fridman:** Okay, all right, and then you erased it?

**Dave Plummer:** 是啊。  
**Dave Plummer:** I did.

**Lex Fridman:** 什么时候爱上编程的？当你意识到这玩意很特别的时候。  
All right. When did you first fall in love with programming? When you figured out, like, this is a, this is something special.

**Dave Plummer:** 分两个阶段。从接触TRS-80开始就着迷到每周骑车去店里泡着。大学二三年级时意识到："我热爱编程，但不知道毕业后要做什么——是去搞录像机闪烁显示？还是开发操作系统？不过既然热爱，船到桥头自然直。"  
**Dave Plummer:** … I think there was two stages for me. I always knew immediately that I was fascinated with these machines, from the TRS-80 Model I. It's all I wanted to do was ride my bike back there and have more time with it. And I did that, you know, to wear out my welcome as much as I could. And the other revelation came, I think about second or third year of university when I realized, "I love programming, but I have no idea what I'm going to do. Am I going to make the 12 flash on a VCR somewhere? Or am I going to go work on an operating system? I have abso- absolutely no idea what I'm going to do post-graduation. But I love what I do." And so, I think that was a lot of consolation. It's like, it doesn't really matter what I'm doing at this point, 'cause I kind of love doing it, so…

**Lex Fridman:** 只要跟着感觉走总会找到方向。  
**Lex Fridman:** So, you'll figure it out. As long as you're following this kind of feeling that's telling you-

**Dave Plummer:** 那时终于确信自己选对了路。  
**Dave Plummer:** I knew I was in the right area, finally. Yeah.
		
## 辍学的岔路与回归 - Dropping out of high-school
		
**Lex Fridman:** 我明白了。对了，听说你高中时有过一段辍学的经历？  
**Lex Fridman:** Yeah. All right. You dropped out of high school.

**Dave Plummer:** 是啊，现在回头看，那确实不是个明智的决定。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah. Not the smartest move.

**Lex Fridman:** 但令人佩服的是，你后来不仅重返校园，学业表现优异，最终还成为了一位非常成功的程序员、开发者和软件创造者。我很想知道，你是如何找到人生方向的？能和我们分享这段从辍学到重新找回自我的历程吗？  
**Lex Fridman:** Okay. But you ended up going back to school and being very successful at school and, just in general, successful as a programmer, as a developer, as a creator of software. How were you able to find your way? Can you tell that journey of dropping out— …and then finding your way back?

**Dave Plummer:** 说实话，其实并没有一个具体的"辍学时刻"。就是今天缺一堂课，明天又缺一堂，慢慢地越去越少，直到有一天你觉得太久没去学校，再露面会很尴尬，最后干脆就不去了——高中辍学往往就是这样不知不觉发生的。如果你发现自己正走在这条路上，我真的劝你及时停下。可惜我当时就是这么过来的。不去上学后总得谋生，于是我就在7-Eleven便利店、油漆仓库这些地方打工。说起来，7-Eleven的工作其实挺有意思的，我感觉这个岗位总是留给那些足够聪明、能胜任夜班所有盘点和管理工作，但又因为各种个人原因不得不留在那里的人。  
**Dave Plummer:** There’s no moment when I dropped out. You just go less and less and less until you realize it’s going to be embarrassing if I show up because I haven’t been there in a long time, and then pretty soon you’re just not going, and that’s how you drop out of high school. So, if you find yourself on that path, stop doing that. But that’s precisely what I did. And so now I’m not at school and I have to get a job, so I’m working at 7-Eleven and a paint warehouse and stuff like that. And 7-Eleven is actually kind of an interesting job because it’s a job I think they keep rotating for people that are smart enough to do the night shift with all the accounting and the administration and stuff they make the night shift do, but that have reasons personally that they need to work at 7-Eleven.

**Dave Plummer:** 我就是这样的人之一，毕竟连高中文凭都没有。  
**Dave Plummer:** And I was one of those people because I had no high school diploma.

**Lex Fridman:** 在7-Eleven工作的那段日子，有什么特别触动你的瞬间吗？或者说，现在回想起来，你怎么看待那份工作带给你的磨砺？  
**Lex Fridman:** What are some memorable moments from that time at 7-Eleven? Or maybe what do you appreciate about the difficulty of that job?

**Dave Plummer:** 要说最难忘的时刻...虽然我也经历过持刀抢劫这种惊险的事，但这些反而像是一种"特别的经历"。但真正让我觉得最难熬的，是测量汽油储罐的油位。我们要用一根特别长的木尺，大概15到20英尺，上面标着刻度。把它伸进地下油罐里，再提上来根据油渍位置读数，因为那时根本没有电子传感器。我第一次干这活儿时，尺子脱手滑落，我下意识伸手去抓——结果双手扎满了木刺。当时外面零下40度，那种滋味真是刻骨铭心。  
**Dave Plummer:** Probably the worst moment for me… I mean, I got held up at knife-point and stuff, and that’s all entertaining, but the worst… …The most… The suckiest part for me was doing the gas dips. We’ve got a long… It’s a, like a 15 or 20-foot wooden stick and it’s measured in gradients of inches and feet, and you drop it into the gasoline tanks and then you bring it up and you measure where the gasoline sits because there’s no electronic sensor. So, I’m doing that, and the first time I do it, I drop the pole and I re-grab it. Well, that’s about a thousand splinters of wood into your hands, and it’s 40 below out and that really sucked.

**Lex Fridman:** 天啊，这听起来太艰难了。  
**Lex Fridman:** Oh, wow.

**Dave Plummer:** 就在那一刻，我内心有个声音特别清晰："我绝不能一辈子过这样的生活。"这个念头异常坚定。  
**Dave Plummer:** And I realized, “I don’t want to do this for a whole life.” I knew that, so…

**Lex Fridman:** 所以你就那样站在严寒中，手上扎满木刺，整个人都冻僵了...  
**Lex Fridman:** Okay. So you stand there frozen with splinters in your hand.

**Dave Plummer:** 就在那个瞬间，我仿佛顿悟了，告诉自己必须改变人生轨迹。虽然几秒钟后我就觉得这想法有点天真，但那个刺痛的时刻确实成了我的转折点。尽管已经21岁，我还是鼓起勇气去找了本地高中的校长，诚恳地问他："我能回来上学吗？"他一开始很为难，说："你年龄太大了，而且我们也没有名额。"但我没有放弃，对他说："从现在到毕业前，总会有人辍学的。到时候就会有名额了。我们就当有名额，我能回来吗？"校长最终被我的诚意打动，同意我回来修完了需要的三四门课。  
**Dave Plummer:** And at some point, I have a revelation about my life that next time I’m going to do it differently. And then how ludicrous that is hits me about three seconds later, right? And I think that was really the moment for me where I realized that I’ve got to do something different. And so even though I was 21, I went and I talked to the principal of my local high school and I was like, “Can you let me back in?” And he’s, “No, you’re too old and we don’t have room,” was his main reason. And I said, “Well, between now and then, somebody’s going to drop out. So, you’ll have room. So, let’s assume you have room. Can I come back?” And he was gracious and let me come back. And so I did the three or four classes that I needed.

**Lex Fridman:** 我想再深入聊聊这种"慢慢辍学"的心理过程。这其实是人脑一种很微妙的状态：你逐渐意识到自己可以不走寻常路。但这种认知也伴随着风险，因为人要融入社会，总有些事情是需要遵守的。  
**Lex Fridman:** Yeah, just if you can linger on that, the slow dropping out. That’s a weird thing that you can do with your brain. You realize to yourself that you don’t have to do the thing that everybody else is doing, and that’s a dangerous realization because, like, you kind of have to be part of society to do certain things.

**Dave Plummer:** 你说得对。  
**Dave Plummer:** Right.

**Lex Fridman:** 一旦你意识到不必随大流，你的人生可能会走向非凡，但也可能面临更多挑战。  
And if you realize you don’t have to do what everybody else is doing, you can either have an incredible life or a really difficult life.

**Dave Plummer:** 问题的关键在于，你每次做的都只是个小决定："今天就逃一次课而已"。但这样的小决定累积起来，不知不觉就变成了影响一生的大决定。这才是最需要警惕的。  
**Dave Plummer:** Well, the problem with that process is you’re making a much smaller decision. “I’m just not gonna go to class today.” And that’s all you’re deciding, but you do that enough times, you’re making a much bigger decision. And that’s the problem.

**Lex Fridman:** 所以，如果你想要走一条不寻常的路，最好是有意识地做出那个重大决定，而不是让一次次小疏漏把你带向不可控的方向。  
**Lex Fridman:** So it’s better to make… If you want to live life in a non-standard way, it’s better to make the big decision explicitly and then you can stop going. Don’t allow yourself to make the slip-ups, though.

**Dave Plummer:** 否则，命运就会替你做出选择。  
**Dave Plummer:** It’ll be made for you eventually.

**Lex Fridman:** 真为你感到高兴，你最终还是回到了正轨，不仅考上大学，还成为优等生。要知道你以前可不是这样的。  
**Lex Fridman:** Okay. Well, you got back, and you eventually went to college and were very successful as a student, and you weren’t that good of a student before.

**Dave Plummer:** 是啊，我高中时确实是个差生。就连大学第一个学期也没太认真。我12年级的几何课没上，需要补修，老师算是勉强让我及格。这件事让我惊出一身冷汗——就因为那1%的分数差距或者老师手下留情，我差点在起步阶段就断送了整个大学前程。幸好这些补习班的成绩不计入正式成绩单。第二学期我彻底洗心革面，真正为自己而学习，这个转变让一切都不同了。  
**Dave Plummer:** No, I was a terrible student in high school, and even my first semester of college, I still wasn’t taking it quite seriously because I got mercy passed in Geometry 90, which is like the makeup class for the Geometry 12th-grade class that I didn’t have. And that scared me because I realized by 1% or the grace of the professor that let me through, I just about ended my entire university career here. So, fortunately, those marks don’t count on your transcript because they’re remedial classes. So, I got kind of a fresh start the next semester and did it for real, and I did it for me, and that made all the difference.

**Lex Fridman:** 基于你的亲身经历，对于那些想要在学业上取得成功的年轻人，你有什么特别想分享的建议吗？  
**Lex Fridman:** What can you speak to maybe by way of advice on how to be successful as a student?

**Dave Plummer:** 我觉得最重要的是找到学校里真正让你热爱的领域——无论是艺术、计算机科学还是手工课。全力投入这些课程，同时也要耐心对待那些必修的困难科目。现在补上这些课，远比将来重新捡起要容易得多。我作为五十多岁的人说这话可能显得轻松，对十五岁的孩子来说确实难以体会，但...这确实是肺腑之言。  
**Dave Plummer:** Well, ideally, there’s some aspect of school that you do enjoy, whether it’s art, whether it’s computer science, whether it’s shop class, whatever. So, go for those classes and just put up with and do the hard stuff because it’s way easier than having to do it later, and that’s easy to say when you’re 50-something. It’s harder to say when you’re 15-something, but— … it makes a lot of sense.

**Lex Fridman:** 谢谢你的真诚分享。我很好奇你是如何从7-Eleven店员一步步走进微软的？这个转变听起来像个奇迹。  
All right. What’s the story of you joining Microsoft? How did we get there from 7-Eleven to Microsoft?

**Dave Plummer:** 确实是个巨大的跨越。我重返校园后，大概在大学三年级暑假，我在电话公司做暑期工，负责把他们的UBNet网络升级到TCP/IP。这工作听起来高大上，其实主要就是换网卡，然后排查为什么换了配置后Lotus软件就跑不起来了——那个年代搞计算机真是各种折腾，但我还是坚持下来了。午休时，我常和同事们坐在美食广场，读一本叫《微软：比尔·盖茨与微软硬盘驱动器的诞生》的书。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah, it’s a big jump. So, I had gone back to school, and I think it was in my third year of university. I was working for the phone company for the summer as a summer job, and I’m doing conversions of their UBNet to TCP/IP and modern networking, which really amounts to swapping cards but then figuring out why their config.sys doesn’t allow Lotus to run anymore because it’s got 10K less than it used to, and it’s just a horrible time to be working in computers, but I was doing it. And at lunch, I’m sitting in the food court with the old and the bored, and I’m reading a book that I had bought called “Microsoft or Bill Gates and the Making of Microsoft Hard Drive,” I think is the title. And it’s a great book.

**Dave Plummer:** 这本书用非常朴实的笔触讲述了微软的创业史和企业文化。我读得如痴如醉，因为那里的一切都让我心驰神往——但问题是，我住在偏远的萨斯喀彻温省，这梦想显得那么不切实际。不过我是个行动派，大学期间我靠自学开发了一个叫HyperCache的软件来赚取生活费，这是为Amiga电脑设计的文件系统缓存工具，因为Amiga系统本身没有这个功能，没想到还挺受欢迎。  
**Dave Plummer:** It’s just sort of a matter-of-fact history of how Microsoft came to be, what it’s like, how it operates, what the people are like there. And I’m reading this book, and I become really entranced by it and fascinating because it sounds like exactly the place that I want to be, but I’m in Saskatchewan, so what am I going to do about it? And what I wound up doing was, I had put myself through school with a program called HyperCache, which is a file system cache for the Amiga because the Amiga didn’t have any out of the box, and it had done reasonably well.

**Dave Plummer:** 于是我做了件很直接的事——翻出所有用户注册卡（那时是共享软件，用户会填卡寄回获取更新通知），一张张寻找邮箱地址带"microsoft"字样的人。最后找到三四个，我就直接发邮件自我介绍："我是萨斯喀彻温省一个学操作系统的学生，正在寻找机会。"现在回想起来，那封信写得可能很青涩。  
**Dave Plummer:** So, I went through my registration cards, because in those days you had a four-by-six card that people had to fill out with their name and their address and, if they had an email, their email, and they’d send it in, they’d get notifications of updates and so on. Well, it’s shareware. And I went through the whole stack looking for anybody with a Microsoft email address, and I found maybe three or four people, and I just cold-emailed them and said, “Hey, I’m an operating system student in Saskatchewan looking for an opportunity.” I don’t remember exactly what I said.

**Dave Plummer:** 幸运的是，一位叫阿拉斯代尔·班克斯的先生回信了，他说："我可以帮你引荐一个人。"通过他的介绍，我联系上了本·斯利夫卡，经过电话面试，他们决定暑假让我参与MS-DOS项目。就这样，我意外地敲开了微软的大门。  
**Dave Plummer:** But one guy, Alasdair Banks, he wrote back and he said, “I know somebody that I can put you in contact with.” And he put me in contact, I think, with a guy named Ben Slifka, who did a phone interview, who eventually wanted to hire me to work on MS-DOS for the summer. So, that’s how I got there.

**Lex Fridman:** 真了不起！你刚提到HyperCache，这个软件是你自己独立开发的？  
**Lex Fridman:** You put yourself through school by… Tell me about HyperCache. You built a piece of software-

**Dave Plummer:** （笑着比喻）它就像是给硬盘驱动器设计的"瘦身程序"。  
**Dave Plummer:** It’s the weight loss program for hard drives.

**Lex Fridman:** 它的实用价值真的能让那么多用户愿意付费？  
**Lex Fridman:** That was sufficiently useful to a large number of people that would somehow give you money?

**Dave Plummer:** 确实带来了不错的收入。我卖出了几千份，每份20或40美元，根据不同版本定价。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah, it made decent money. I mean, I sold a couple thousand copies. At 20 bucks a copy or 40 bucks a copy, depending on the rules.

**Lex Fridman:** 是用什么语言开发的？  
**Lex Fridman:** What program, what language was it written in?

**Dave Plumme:** 主要用C语言。性能关键部分用了68,000汇编语言，确保数据缓存交换的效率，其他部分都是C语言实现。  
**Dave Plummer:** C. So there were some assemblers. The actual really tight code to do the real work of transferring data to and from the cache was 68,000 assembly. Everything else was C.

**Lex Fridman:** 是类似文件系统输入输出的底层操作吗？  
**Lex Fridman:** Okay. This is like file system I/O?

**Dave Plummer:** 更接近设备块级别的输入输出。所有从驱动器读取的数据块都会先经过我的缓存处理。这是个N路组相联缓存，会智能匹配驱动器特性，还能根据访问模式进行预读取优化。  
**Dave Plummer:** Device block I/O. So any block that gets serviced from the drive would go through my cache first, and it was an N-way associative cache, and so it would try to match the geometry of the drive and do pre-fetch based on you're trying to read a whole track at one time, that kind of thing.

**Lex Fridman:** 我特别好奇，在互联网还不发达的年代，你是怎么把软件推广出去的？  
**Lex Fridman:** What was it like trying to get your software out there at that time? How were you able to find customers?

**Dave Plummer:** （眼神温暖地回忆）这个过程很有意思。我最初是在Usenet和Amiga论坛上发帖，提供30天试用版让大家体验。后来渐渐有了口碑，被几家零售商看中。我永远记得那个场景：我和现在的妻子坐在她的车里，她那时有个手机——因为她父亲特别担心她的安全。那是80年代末，车顶装着天线，后备箱里放着硕大的手机主机。突然接到一家软件零售商的电话，要采购50份，每份20美元。对当时的我来说，1000美元简直是天文数字。后来陆续又有几家公司批量采购，就这样慢慢做了起来。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah, it's interesting. I think I started on Usenet and some of the Amiga forums, posted, "Here's my trial version, try it out for 30 days, see what you like." And eventually it got picked up by a few retailers, and I remember I was with my… Now wife in her car, and she had a cell phone, because her dad was very concerned about her safety. And so this is late '80s, and she's got, you know, the antenna on the roof and the big box in the trunk, the whole deal. But we got a call from one of the software retailers that wanted to buy 50 copies at… 20 Bucks, which to me is a thousand bucks, which in 1989 or whatever year it is was a big deal. And so eventually a number of companies just bought inventory.
		
## <font color="#002060">加入微软 - Joining Microsoft </font>
		
**Lex Fridman:** 咱们聊聊那个年代吧。比尔·盖茨和微软的崛起期太有意思了。你觉得当时微软为什么能统治软件和个人电脑领域，而且这种优势还能持续几十年？  
**Lex Fridman:** Let's go to that time. It's such an interesting time with Bill Gates and Microsoft. Why do you think Microsoft was dominating the software and the personal computing space at that time and, and really for many, many, many years after?

**Dave Plummer:** 那是我见过最强大的聪明人聚集地。我在学术界和工业界都待过——在普通电脑公司工作时，那个真正懂技术的人，他更聪明的朋友多半就在微软。所以当你入职时，还觉得自己是小地方来的高手，结果瞬间陷入"我还是别开口免得露怯"的状态。  
**Dave Plummer:** At the time, it was the single most potent assemblage of smart people that I've ever been a part of. And I've been in academia and I've been in industry to a certain extent, and you know, when you're working at a regular computer company, the one guy who actually knows what he's doing, his smarter friend? He probably works at Microsoft. So when you get there, you're the big cheese from your small town, you think you know a lot, and all of a sudden, you're just in an environment where, like, "Uh-oh, I'm just not going to speak because I don't want to look stupid."

**Lex Fridman:** 比尔·盖茨本人有哪些特质促成了微软的成功？  
**Lex Fridman:** Okay. What about Bill Gates himself? What are some qualities of Bill Gates that you think contribute to the success of Microsoft?

**Dave Plummer:** 他对"让每个家庭、每张桌子都有电脑"这个梦想的追求简直是不遗余力。他非常聪明且极度坚定，更关键的是他招募了和他一样甚至更聪明的人，组建了一支近乎无敌的智力军团。他们做的产品其实很简单，像MS-DOS并不复杂，但恰好是那个时代市场最需要的东西。  
**Dave Plummer:** I think he was relentless in the pursuit of his one dream, which was his old slogan of a computer in every home and a computer on every desk. It was his special interest, and he was a smart guy, super determined, and he hired people that were as smart or smarter than him to help him execute it. And he built an almost unstoppable machine of intellect to go forth and make, let's say, very simple products. MS-DOS is not a complicated product by any stretch, but it's exactly what the market needed at that time.

**Lex Fridman:** MS-DOS确实改变了游戏规则。你加入的正是MS-DOS团队，而且是在Windows 95发布之前？聊聊MS-DOS的故事吧，它的成功应该是微软崛起的关键。  
**Lex Fridman:** MS-DOS changed the game. And that's actually the team you joined, the MS-DOS team, and I think you joined before Windows 95. Was released. So tell me about the story of MS-DOS. Its success is probably pivotal to the success of Microsoft.

**Dave Plummer:** 在DOS之前微软主要是语言公司，给各种电脑做BASIC、Fortran和Pascal编译器。但他们让MS-DOS成为每台PC标配的协议，这实际上确立了一个能沿用几十年的标准。这里面有运气成分，但也是步妙棋——虽然没向IBM收多少钱，但成为标准带来的长期优势太大了。  
**Dave Plummer:** Before DOS, they were largely a language company, so they had made BASIC for a lot of computers, and they had a Fortran compiler and a Pascal compiler, that kind of thing. But their deal to have MS-DOS included with every version or every instance of the PC effectively set them as a standard that they were able to leverage for decades going forward. To a certain extent, they lucked into that, and on the other hand, they were smart to have done it. They didn't charge IBM a lot of money for it, but making it a standard really played out to their advantage over time.
		
## MS-DOS		
		
**Lex Fridman:** 那么在当时，MS-DOS是没有图形界面的。你能简单解释一下MS-DOS到底是什么吗？  
**Lex Fridman:** So at that time, MS-DOS, no graphical interface. Can you just speak to what the heck MS-DOS is?

**Dave Plummer:** 它本质上是个命令启动器。你输入一个命令名，系统会查找这个命令是否在当前目录或特定的文件夹路径下，如果找到了就加载到内存中执行。这就是MS-DOS 90%的功能。它虽然有环境变量、一些复杂功能和内置的小型脚本语言，但基本上就是一个操作系统外壳，让你能使用计算机的资源，比如硬盘或CPU，而且它不支持多任务，也没有图形界面。不过微软后来在DOS 5.0里增加了基于文本的图形界面，用于编辑器和QuickBASIC等程序，MS-DOS 4.0还有个DOS Shell，算是一种图形化的文件管理器。  
**Dave Plummer:** It's largely a command launcher. So you type in a name of a command, it looks it up to see if that's in the current directory or on a special path of folders, and it loads it into memory and executes it if it's there. And that's 90% of what MS-DOS does. Now, it has environment variables and some complexity and a small scripting language built in, but it is basically just an operating system shell that allows you to use the resources of the computer, like the hard drive or the CPU, and it doesn't allow you to multitask. There's no graphical interface. Now, Microsoft did a- add a text-based graphical interface for things like an editor and QuickBASIC in DOS 5.0, I believe, and there was a DOS shell, which was sort of a graphical file manager in MS-DOS 4.0.

**Dave Plummer:** 所以他们确实做过一些尝试，但核心还是个命令提示符。  
**Dave Plummer:** So they experimented with it, but it's largely a command prompt.

**Lex Fridman:** 它能与外部设备通信吗？比如驱动程序之类的？MS-DOS作为一个操作系统，它的功能范围有多大？  
Does it have the ability to communicate with external devices, so drivers and all that kind of stuff? How expansive of an operating system was MS-DOS?

**Dave Plummer:** 它受限于最初的x86指令集，内存被限制在640K。然后人们在上面打了各种"补丁"来实现高端内存和扩展内存，想方设法让程序运行时不占用基本内存，得费很大周折。  
**Dave Plummer:** Well, it was limited by the original x86 instruction set, which limited it to 640K. And then there were various Band-Aids on top of that to do high mem and then extended memory beyond that, and a lot of hoops have to be jumped through to make anything work without consuming base RAM.

**Lex Fridman:** 是啊，你是在MS-DOS上编程的。那是什么感觉？有什么有趣的细节吗？就像你提到的640KB内存限制。  
**Lex Fridman:** Yeah, I mean, you programmed on MS-DOS. What's it like? What are some interesting details there? Like you said, there's the memory constraints of 640 kilobytes.

**Dave Plummer:** 对，640K是当时能用的最大内存了，但这可不是给操作系统开发者用的，因为你用掉的每一字节内存，用户就少用一字节。所以如果你无缘无故多用了10K，那么全世界的每台电脑就少了10K可用内存，这责任可不小。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah, 640K is the maximum that's ever gonna be available, so it's not what's available to you as an operating system developer, because whatever you use is what the user won't get. So if you use 10K needlessly, you're gonna… Every machine in the world now has 10K less, so it's kind of a big responsibility.

**Lex Fridman:** 比尔·盖茨是不是真的说过那句有名的话？  
**Lex Fridman:** Is that a true quote from Bill Gates, where he said,

**Dave Plummer:** "640K内存对任何人都足够了"？不，不是他说的。这话被安在他头上，但不是真的。  
**Dave Plummer:** Nobody will ever need more than 640K? Yeah, no, it's not him. It's been attributed to him, but not real.

**Lex Fridman:** 你作为实习生加入MS-DOS团队后，做了哪些有意思的工作？  
**Lex Fridman:** What are some interesting aspects of what you were able to do as an intern and when you joined on MS-DOS and beyond?

**Dave Plummer:** 我最早做的工作之一就是改进SmartDrive这个磁盘缓存工具，因为我对磁盘缓存比较熟悉——我给它增加了CD-ROM缓存功能，因为那时CD-ROM刚出现。微软电子书架是少数能用到这个功能的产品之一。可想而知，如果能巧妙实现CD缓存，速度能提升几十倍。所以这是个很重要的性能优化，也是个很好的项目。更重要的部分是把SmartDrive和一些功能，以及后来的磁盘压缩引擎DoubleSpace，移到了所谓的高位内存区。  
**Dave Plummer:** One of the first things I did was to take SmartDrive, the disk cache, 'cause I had familiarity with disk caches- and to add CD-ROM caching to it, because that was new. CD-ROMs were just coming out. Microsoft Bookshelf is one of the few products you could run for it. And as you can imagine, caching a CD speeds it up by dozens of times if you're smart about it. So it was a big performance win and a nice thing to work on. A bigger part of that was moving a bunch of SmartDrive and eventually the double-space compression engine up into what's known as high memory.

**Dave Plummer:** 如果不深入技术细节的话，在x86架构上有个叫做A20线的东西。我可能记反了，只有50%的把握说对——如果A20线被激活，你的内存指针会在1MB处回绕。  
**Dave Plummer:** And without rat holing on the technical aspect of it, on the x86, there's something I believe called the A20 line. And I probably have this backwards, or I got a 50-50 shot at it, but if you've got the A20 line asserted, then your memory pointers wrap at the one megabyte mark.

**Dave Plummer:** 如果没有激活，就不会回绕。这样你就可以继续往更高地址寻址。通过组合段寄存器和偏移寄存器得到一个大于1MB的地址，你就能访问1MB以上的内存，从而多获得64K空间。你把代码放在那里，然后在低内存区设置存根跳转到那里。通过这种方式，你可以从机器上再榨出64K内存，我们有几个产品就是这么做的。说实话，我当时根本不知道HIMEM是什么，因为我来微软之前是Amiga程序员，从来没写过x86代码……  
**Dave Plummer:** And if not, they don't. So you continue going up in memory. So you can rewrite memory above by combining your segment and offset registers to a number bigger than one megabyte, and you get an extra 64K. And you put your code in there, and then you just put stubs to jump to it from low memory. And so you can get another 64K out of the machine that way, and we did that for a couple of the products. And that's … I had no idea what HIMEM was, 'cause I was an Amiga programmer and I'd never written any x86 code before I got there, so …

## Windows 95		
		
**Lex Fridman:** 这么说来，你参与的这些优化工作确实很酷。那Windows方面呢？当时Windows 95也在并行开发吧？你有机会和那个团队交流吗？  
**Lex Fridman:** So that was, like, a cool optimization you got to be a part of. So what about Windows? There was a parallel development of Windows 95, right, at that time. Did you get a chance to interact with those folks?

**Dave Plummer:** 我其实在Windows 95项目上工作了大概三四个月。当时在COM/OLE团队负责演示缓存，就是当你在Word文档里插入一个Word或Excel表格、图表时，你不希望每次显示都要加载Excel，所以系统会用增强图元文件做个演示缓存，我就是做这个的。这个功能随Windows 95发布了，但我到微软大约半年后就转到了Shell团队，从那以后就开始做NT了。  
**Dave Plummer:** I actually worked on Windows 95 for about three or four months. I was on the COM/OLE team doing the presentation cache, which is when you insert a, say, a Word or an Excel spreadsheet or chart into a Word document. You don't want Excel to have to be loaded to render it every time, so there's a presentation cache of enhanced metafiles and I was working on that. So that shipped in Windows 95, but I moved to the Shell team about six months after getting to Microsoft, and so I worked on NT from there forward.

**Lex Fridman:** 好的，那95和NT分别是什么？  
**Lex Fridman:** Okay, and what's 95? What's NT?

**Dave Plummer:** Windows 95是最初16位的Windows 3.1的演进版，而3.1是第一个真正流行的Windows版本。95增加了32位支持、VxD驱动程序和一堆新技术，还有全新的用户界面。在当时是具有革命性的。人们甚至会在夜里排队购买。  
**Dave Plummer:** Windows 95 is an evolution of the original 16-bit Windows 3.1, which was the very first popular version of Windows. And it adds 32-bit support, then VxD drivers and a bunch of new technology and an entirely new user interface. And it's something that at the time was revolutionary. The people lined up at night to wait in line to buy the thing.

**Lex Fridman:** 你能带我们回到那个时代，描述一下为什么95相对于3.1是一个巨大的飞跃吗？毕竟苹果早就有图形界面了，Windows 3.1也有图形界面。为什么Windows 95如此不同凡响？  
Can you just take us back to that time and describe why 95 was such a big leap from 3.1? So Apple already had a graphical interface. Windows 3.1 had a graphical interface. Why was Windows 95 such a gigantic leap?

**Dave Plummer:** 我不想简单归功于开始菜单，虽然它确实是重要部分……但我记得第一次看到95时，我说不清具体是哪里不同和出色，但我就知道自己想成为它的一部分，这也就是为什么我开始写Shell扩展，后来这个扩展变成了Zip文件夹功能。我就是被这个新的Shell深深吸引，所以才最终加入了那个将Shell移植到NT（也就是今天Windows的基础）的团队。  
**Dave Plummer:** I don't want to make it as basic as the Start menu, but I think… …It's a big part of it. I know when I first saw it… …I couldn't quantify what about it was different and awesome, but I realized that I wanted to be a part of it, and that's why I started writing a Shell extension, which became Zip folders at some point. But I was just fascinated by the new Shell, and that's why I wound up working on the team that brought that Shell over to the NT and what's Windows today.

**Lex Fridman:** 你会认为它是有史以来最伟大的操作系统吗？哪个操作系统影响力最大？  
**Lex Fridman:** Would you say that's the greatest operating system ever? What's the most impactful operating system ever?

**Dave Plummer:** Windows 95在我这儿排第二。我认为OS/360是第一名。  
**Dave Plummer:** Windows 95 would be number two for me. I think OS/360 is going to be number one.

**Lex Fridman:** 哦，有意思。  
**Lex Fridman:** Okay, interesting.

**Dave Plummer:** 因为你在1962年为一台机器写个COBOL程序，跳进时光机，去到波基普西，启动一台IBM z17大型机，今天还能运行它。IBM保持这种兼容性已经不知道多少年了。这主要是在商业领域，我们消费者不太接触得到，但我觉得它在商业领域的影响力，可能就像Windows 95在家庭领域的影响力一样大。Linux在我这儿可能排第三。我把Linux排在Unix之前，虽然这么说不太对，因为没有Unix就没有Linux，但Unix、BSD等的影响主要是在学术领域。那是程序员为程序员设计的。  
**Dave Plummer:** Because you could take a machine and write a COBOL program for it in 1962, jump in your time machine, go to Poughkeepsie and boot up an IBM z17 mainframe and run it today. And they've been doing it for however many years that is. And it's all on the business side, so we as consumers don't have much access to it, but I think it was probably as influential in the commercial side as Windows 95 was in the home side. And then probably Linux would be number three for me. I put Linux as bigger than Unix, which doesn't work because you can't have one without the other, but the impact of Unix, BSD, and so forth, is largely in the academic space. It's by programmers for programmers.

**Lex Fridman:** 确实，Linux创造了……它是开源精神最大规模的体现，对吧？它几乎创造了一个社区，一种编程精神，并延续至今。这是真的。规模确实重要。  
**Lex Fridman:** So, yeah, Linux created… I mean, it was the embodiment of the open source spirit at its largest scale. Right? So it almost created a community and it created a spirit of programming that propagates to this day. That's true. That's true. Like scale matters.

**Dave Plummer:** 是的，而且它现在在服务器端的普及程度，我不知道是否达到了System/360的成就，但几乎是无处不在的，所以……  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah, and its penetration on the server side of things now is, I don't know if it's equivalent to what System/360 achieved, but it's almost ubiquitous, so…

**Lex Fridman:** 是啊，这个世界……这算是宇宙的一个安静的秘密了，很多东西都跑在Linux上。好了，跟我聊聊你当时的工作日常吧。在MS-DOS和Windows 95那个年代，一天是怎么过的？描述一个典型的工作日。  
**Lex Fridman:** Yeah, the world… I mean, this is the quiet secret of the universe, is it runs on Linux. Okay, so tell me about your work days. What were they like back then? Back in the MS-DOS and Windows 95 days? Take me through a productive day.

**Dave Plummer:** 嗯，一天开始，你得先下载通讯录。那时微软有1万到1万5千名员工，我们都用MS Mail。我们刚从一个叫Miss Piggy的PDP-11机器（跑Whizmail）上迁移过来，开始用MS Mail。但MS Mail有个固定的通讯录，每个用户每天早上都必须下载。当1万个人都在下载包含1万人的通讯录时，情况就有点混乱了。我记得当时用的是10兆网络，所以每天第一个小时就在下载通讯录，总是很让人烦躁。但你会利用这个时间查看夜间“压力测试”产生的崩溃报告。  
**Dave Plummer:** Well, your day starts coming in and you've got to download the address book, which is… Microsoft has between 10 and 15,000 employees at this point, and we're all on MS Mail. We're just getting off of the PDP-11 called Miss Piggy, which ran Whizmail, and we're running MS Mail. But MS Mail has a fixed address book that every user must download every morning, and when there are 10,000 people downloading 10,000 people, it gets pretty messy. And I think we were on 10 megabit networking at the time, so your first hour is downloading the address book, which was always frustrating. But you'd use that time to look at the crashes that would have happened overnight from a process we called Stress, which is NNT…

**Dave Plummer:** 所有闲置的机器整晚都在运行测试，试图让自己崩溃。如果哪台机器真的崩溃了，它会通过串口线连到另一台机器上的调试器里，这样你就可以连接到那台机器，远程调试崩溃的机器。所以你到公司后，他们会把崩溃问题分派好，比如“开始菜单崩溃了，分给Dave处理”。所以你到公司第一件事就是连接上去处理，因为你得把那台机器还给它的主人，解除锁定。所以每天第一个小时基本上就是处理夜间压力测试产生的崩溃问题，之后可能就回去写代码了，但不幸的是，80%的时间是在修复bug，尤其是在我的职业生涯里，  
**Dave Plummer:** All the machines that are unused run tests all night long and they try to crash themselves, and if they manage to crash themselves, it will drop into a debugger with a serial cable to another machine and you can connect to that other machine and remotely debug the crashed machine. So you come in and they will have triaged bugs, you know, there was a crash in the Start menu, so we'll assign that to Dave, and so you come in and that's your first thing, is to connect, because you've got to get that machine back to the guy that owns it and unlock the machine, so that's your first hour of your day, is basically triage for bugs that have come up from Stress overnight and then at that point it's probably back to coding, which unfortunately 80% of the time is fixing bugs, especially in my career it

**Dave Plummer:** 就是移植代码和修复bug。我写的新代码不多，当然也有例外。我会私下写很多新代码来满足自己的创作欲……毕竟日复一日总是修复别人代码里的bug，虽然也是极好的学习经历。  
**Dave Plummer:** was porting code and fixing bugs. I wasn't writing a lot of new code and there were exceptions. I wrote a lot of new code on the side to get it out of my system… …From a day-to-day grind of always fixing bugs in other people's code, which is amazing learning experience.

**Lex Fridman:** 所以你在微软做了很多……是把Windows 95的代码移植到NT上吗？  
**Lex Fridman:** So you did a lot of the… At Microsoft, you did a lot of the porting of what is it, Windows 95 code to NT?

**Dave Plummer:** 是的。我们把整个Windows 95的用户界面都移植到了NT上，其中一项工作就是让它支持Unicode。也就是说，所有原来是8位的东西都要变成16位。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah. We took the entire Windows 95 user interface, and we ported it to NT, which meant making it Unicode, for one thing. So everything that was eight bits is now 16 bits.

**Lex Fridman:** 明白。  
**Lex Fridman:** Okay.

**Dave Plummer:** ……指针。你可以想象，转换代码的时候简直是一团糟。  
**Dave Plummer:** …pointers. It's quite a mess when you switch the code over, as you can imagine.

**Lex Fridman:** 能给我们讲讲移植工作具体涉及什么吗？  
Can you give us insights into what is involved in porting?

**Dave Plummer:** 这就像闯进别人家里，翻遍他们所有的东西，看到他们不想让你看到的抽屉里的内容。你会发现好东西，比如墙上挂的漂亮画作，也会在床头柜里发现一些令人不安的东西。我见过有代码一行有200个字符那么宽，里面还有脏话。到我离开的时候，这些代码多年来都被清理干净了。但当时的代码并不总是世界上最专业的。  
**Dave Plummer:** It's like breaking into somebody's house and going through all their stuff and seeing the stuff in their drawers that they didn't want you to see. You find all the good stuff, the pretty pictures hanging on the wall, and you find some disturbing stuff in the nightstand. I saw code that was like 200 characters wide with, you know, profanity and swears in it. It eventually got all cleaned up over the years by the time I left. But it was not always the most professional code in the world.

**Lex Fridman:** 没错，因为你必须检查每一行代码。  
**Lex Fridman:** Right, because every single piece of code you have to go through.

**Dave Plummer:** 一行一行地看，所以什么都瞒不过你。  
**Dave Plummer:** Line by line, so you see it all.

**Lex Fridman:** 是啊。这就是程序员的宿命。你写了一段代码，以为永远不会有人看到。但有时，很多时候，这段代码会被后来很多人看到，包括五年后的你自己，回头看自己的代码。好了，那么跟我聊聊Windows NT吧。那也是一个巨大的飞跃。  
**Lex Fridman:** Yeah. I mean, that's the story of programmers. You write a piece of code, and you think it'll never be seen by anybody. And sometimes, oftentimes, that code is going to be seen by a very large number of people, …that come after you, including you five years later. You yourself looking at your own code. Okay, so tell me about Windows NT. That was a giant leap too.

**Dave Plummer:** 确实是。它基本上是从零开始设计的。微软从数字设备公司挖来了Dave Cutler，他为他们做过VMS和RSX-11等操作系统。我记得是在DEC West的Prism和MICA项目被取消后，他来到了微软。他带着一整支项目被取消的团队，基本上都来到了微软。我不知道具体交易细节，但他们全来了。所以你有Dave Cutler、Mark Lucovsky这些来自DEC的非常聪明的人，他们基本上是白手起家，但OS/2也算是个起点。不过OS/2是用汇编语言写的，而NT要用C语言写。  
**Dave Plummer:** It was. It was basically a clean-sheet design. So they went and they got Dave Cutler from Digital Equipment, who had done operating systems for them, VMS and RSX-11, he had done. And so he came over after, I believe it was Prism and MICA were some projects at DEC West that got canceled. And so you had a whole team of guys where their project is canceled, and basically, they took a whole bunch of them and came to Microsoft. And I don't know the specifics of the deal, but they all showed up. So you had Dave Cutler and Mark Lucovsky and all these really smart guys from DEC, and they did basically a clean sheet, but they also had OS/2 as a starting point. But OS/2 was, of course, written in assembly language, and NT is going to be written in C.

**Dave Plummer:** 至于他们在多大程度上借鉴了OS/2，我不太清楚，但至少他们有了一个可以起步的系统。  
**Dave Plummer:** So to what extent they were able to leverage any of that, I don't actually know, but at least they had a system to start with.
		
## The man behind Windows		

**Windows 背后的灵魂人物**

**Lex Fridman:** 你刚才提到戴夫·卡特勒是Windows背后的关键人物。能具体聊聊他吗？  
**Lex Fridman:** You said that Dave Cutler’s the man, the mind behind Windows. Can you explain?

**Dave Plummer:** 戴夫·卡特勒是内核架构师。就好比Linux世界有林纳斯，Windows世界就有戴夫·C。  
**Dave Plummer:** So Dave Cutler is the architect of the kernel. So he is Linus in the Linux world. It’s Dave C. in the Windows world.

**Lex Fridman:** 明白了，戴夫·C。  
**Lex Fridman:** Yeah. Dave C., okay.

**Dave Plummer:** 当然不是说没有其他重要贡献者，但我觉得他是背后的核心驱动力，一直如此。他现在应该85岁了，依然每天写代码。作为微软院士，据我所知他至今仍去公司上班。  
**Dave Plummer:** And it’s not that there weren’t other people that contributed, of course, huge pieces to it. But I think he’s the driving force behind it and always largely has been. And he’s still… I think he’s 85 now. He still codes every day. He’s a Microsoft Fellow. He, as far as I know, still goes into work, so…

**Lex Fridman:** 能说说他的过人之处吗？和他共事、接触后，你觉得他思维方式最特别的地方是什么？  
Can you speak to the genius of that guy? Like, what’s interesting about his mind, having worked with him, having interacted with Dave Cutler?

**Dave Plummer:** 他不仅聪明绝顶，还有点儿像老农——会盯着你把事情做对、做好，绝不允许任何垃圾代码混进他的操作系统。在这方面他是个严师，但我觉得这很值得，因为让微软的开发者适应戴夫那种数字设备公司的强硬风格，本身就是一个巨大的范式转变。  
**Dave Plummer:** Well, the dude’s wicked smart, but he’s also like a farmer. He’s like the guy that will follow you around and make sure that stuff gets done and gets done right to make sure that you’re not checking any crap into his operating system. And he won’t tolerate it. And he’s a real taskmaster in that regard, but I think it really paid off ’cause it was a very big paradigm shift for Microsoft developers to be subjected to the Dave Cutler Digital Equipment style of leadership.

**Lex Fridman:** 从那段经历中，你对成功的软件团队协作有什么领悟？当时微软聚集了大量优秀工程师，还有戴夫这样的灵魂人物，他们必须从头打造许多我们至今仍在使用的系统。关于打造卓越的工程团队，你学到了什么？  
**Lex Fridman:** What did you learn from that about successful software teams, where there’s a large number of people collaborating? Because Microsoft had a lot of brilliant engineers back then, and like you said, Dave Cutler. They had to they had to create completely new systems, many of which we still use today. What have you learned about great software engineering teams from that time?

**Dave Plummer:** 我觉得工具至关重要——当然人也一样。但工具链是个巨大因素。如果当时有Git，事情会轻松太多。我们那时用的是Diff和手动打增量补丁来做移植。能轻松分支出源代码对当时的我来说简直是奢望，要是有就太方便了。  
**Dave Plummer:** Tools are everything, I think, for one. And people are everything. We’ll grant that. But the tool set is a huge factor. If we went ahead with Git, it would have been immensely easier. We were using Diff and, you know, manual Deltas. …To do this porting and stuff. So being able to fork a branch of source code would be a luxury that is new to me. At the time, it would have been really handy.

**Lex Fridman:** 那时有没有什么难忘的对话？比如你走到同事旁边——  
**Lex Fridman:** What were some memorable conversations from that time when you walked over next door-

**Dave Plummer:** 嗯，有件事我虽然不在场——  
**Dave Plummer:** Well, what…

**Lex Fridman:** ——和他们聊起来的？  
**Lex Fridman:** … and talked to some of these folks?

**Dave Plummer:** 是有个新加入团队的成员，在负责一个叫“开罗”的未来操作系统项目。这个系统本应比Win95更华丽，但最终没成型。那位同事在几千人都在的NT开发邮件列表里吐槽NT的启动体验有多烂。结果收到的回复是一封史诗级的怒斥邮件——真希望我当时存下来了。我不便点名是谁写的，但他自己心里清楚。那邮件堪称愤怒邮件的艺术品，有点像偶尔看到的林纳斯关于内核的暴怒邮件，风格很像。  
**Dave Plummer:** …I was not present for was, somebody was complaining, a new hire came into the team and was working on what I believe was called Cairo. Cairo was going to be the next future operating system, was going to be beautiful, and have a whole new user interface newer than Windows 95, and it never materialized. But while they were working on it, one of the guys working on Cairo was kind of flaming on the open NT dev alias, which is thousands of people, how shitty the NT boot experience was. The response that came back was an epic flame that I wish I would have saved, and I won’t name the guy who wrote it. He knows who he is, but… … It was a work of art of angry flame mail, kind of like the ones you see Linus send every now and then about kernel stuff. So it’s a very similar sentiment.

**Lex Fridman:** 那时候会有那种学术辩论吗？就是——  
**Lex Fridman:** Were there, like, kind of intellectual debates, like-

**Dave Plummer:** 哦，当然有。  
**Dave Plummer:** Oh yeah.

**Lex Fridman:** ——工程师之间争论得很激烈的情况？  
**Lex Fridman:** … there’s some, some heated stuff with the engineers?

**Dave Plummer:** 确实……有时会变得很有火药味。当一群聪明人相互竞争时，对某些人来说技术优劣反而成了次要的，重点变成了在争论中压倒对方。往往到那时辩论就失去建设性了，但这类情况还真不少。  
**Dave Plummer:** It was… Yeah, it got contentious. So you’ve got intellects competing, and eventually, the technical merits for some people are secondary, and it’s about besting the other person in that argument. And it’s no longer productive at that point half the time, but there was a fair bit of that.

**Lex Fridman:** 我在编程语言设计社区也见过类似争论，比如吉多·范罗苏姆那样的社区领袖，这种争论会让他们很疲惫，因为大家有时会忘了初衷，开始纠结细枝末节。工程师们聚在一起，甚至可能为了一点语法细节争执不休。  
**Lex Fridman:** Yeah, I’ve seen those kind of debates in programming language design communities, like Guido van Rossum, the leaders of those communities, it can wear them down because people get… You almost forget the mission you’re on and start being very nitpicky about the details. I mean, engineering minds get together, and you just go to war over the stupidest, like, syntax subtlety.

**Dave Plummer:** 没错。  
**Dave Plummer:** Right.

**Lex Fridman:** 当然我不能说那些细节“愚蠢”，但对编程语言来说可能只是微小的语法差异。我猜内核组件内部肯定也有过类似的激烈争论。  
**Lex Fridman:** Well, I shouldn’t say stupid, but it’s a small syntax subtlety for programming language. I’m sure there are internal battles about specific kernel components.

**Dave Plummer:** 是啊，有场争论我输了，到现在想起来还觉得憋屈。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah, I mean, there’s one that I lost that still bugs me to this day, I think.

**Lex Fridman:** 哦？具体是什么事？  
**Lex Fridman:** Okay, yeah. What’s that?

**Dave Plummer:** 因为我始终觉得自己是对的。当时我们在移植Shell，要把所有代码从ANSI转为Unicode，也就是8位字符全变成16位。问题是我用的MIPS机器（正在移植到RISC架构）不支持非对齐地址访问。如果你把两个ID列表（基本上是路径组件）拼接起来，比如"C:"、"Windows"、"System32"，字符数是奇数的话，地址就会不对齐。我得做大量额外工作：启用异常处理、进行非对齐字节访问、手动复制字符串等等。  
**Dave Plummer:** ‘Cause I still think was right. Well, when we were doing the shell, we were porting everything from ANSI to Unicode, so every character that was eight bits now becomes 16 bits. Now, the problem is I’m on a MIPS box ’cause I’m porting it to RISC…. and you can’t have unaligned addresses. But if you take two ID lists, which are basically past components, you take the one for C colon backslash, take the one for Windows, take the one for System32, and you add them together. But if you’ve got an odd number of characters, now you’re at an odd address in this thing, and it takes me an immense amount of work to turn on exception handlers, to do unaligned byte access, to pull the string out and copy it manually.

**Dave Plummer:** 在MIPS机器上从这种非对齐的ID列表里读取字符串，工作量可能要多上百倍甚至千倍。所以我当时据理力争，尽管Win95开发已近尾声、都发布过Beta版了，我们还是应该保证ID列表的字节数始终为偶数，或者用个取巧办法避免这种情况，这样相关代码就能全速运行。结果争论变成了吵架甚至人身攻击，最后我输了。我至今仍认为，现在Windows里那段代码的运行速度比它本该有的慢了几千倍——虽然没人介意，因为已经够快了，但它本可以快得多的。  
**Dave Plummer:** And it’s literally like a hundred to a thousand times the amount of work to read a string out of this ID list on a MIPS machine because it’s unaligned. So I’m having the argument that even though it’s late in the Windows 95, they’ve already shipped one beta, that we should now just guarantee that ID lists are always an even number of bytes, or do some hack to just make sure this never happens so the code that references them on all this hard work can just blaze through it. And it became a shouting match and sort of a personal match and I lost that one. And I still think that, I know today, that that code running on Windows is thousands of times slower than it has to be and it- nobody cares ’cause it’s plenty fast but- …it could be a lot faster.


## Debugging		

**调试的艺术**

**Lex Fridman:** 说到MIPS和RISC架构，当时你需要对底层理解到什么程度？无论是软件最底层还是硬件层面。要成功完成NT及其之前的工作，需要穿透多少层抽象？  
**Lex Fridman:** Yeah. So yeah, I mean you mentioned MIPS and RISC. How deeply did you have to understand the lowest level? Sort of the lowest level of the software and even the hardware with the stuff you were building. Like what are the layers of the abstractions you had to understand to be successful with all the stuff you're doing with NT and before that with…

**Dave Plummer:** 每天差不多一半时间都在调试，而且大部分时候都是在纯汇编的调用栈里打转——因为那时根本没有源码级调试。不像现在用Visual Studio，命中断点就直接显示源代码。虽然你能查看源码，但实际面对的始终是机器吐出的原始汇编代码。  
**Dave Plummer:** Well, about half your day is going to be spent debugging, and most of the time is going to be spent in call stacks that are in pure assembly language because there's no source level debugging. So it's not like we're in Visual Studio, and you hit a breakpoint, and it pops up, and there's the source code. You can go look at the source code, but you're looking at the raw assembly dump from the machine at all times.

**Lex Fridman:** 所以即使是用C编程，调试也得看汇编？  
**Lex Fridman:** So even if you're programming in C, the debugging is in assembly?

**Dave Plummer:** 对，百分之百是这样。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah, 100%.

**Lex Fridman:** 天啊。  
**Lex Fridman:** Oh man.

**Dave Plummer:** 确实有点麻烦。  
**Dave Plummer:** So it's a little cumbersome.

**Lex Fridman:** 唉。  
**Lex Fridman:** Oh.

**Dave Plummer:** 更"棒"的是，我们要同时处理四种指令集：Intel、MIPS、Alpha和PowerPC。机器在哪套架构上崩溃，你就得面对完全不同的指令集和寄存器。所以你得熟练调试所有四种，不过我对MIPS更熟些，所以MIPS的问题常会交给我。  
**Dave Plummer:** And better yet, we're doing four instruction sets because we're doing Intel MIPS, Alpha, and PowerPC. So depending on which machine it crashes on, you've got an entirely different instruction set… …That registers. And so you get reasonably adept at debugging all four, but I had more experience in MIPS, so MIPS stuff would come my way.

**Lex Fridman:** 这简直是耐力考验。能聊聊这种调试的折磨吗？尤其在没有现代工具辅助的情况下。现在的年轻人可能觉得编程就是创造酷炫的东西，但其实很多时间是在修东西对吧？  
**Lex Fridman:** That's a real endurance event. I mean, can you speak to that? The torture there is debugging, especially that kind of debugging without the tooling associated with it. I mean that's, you know, programming, kids these days, programming isn't all about creating beautiful things, right? It's also about fixing things.

**Dave Plummer:** 是啊，我职业生涯大概20%时间在创造，80%在调试和修复。我因为比较擅长解决疑难杂症而有点名气，所以这类活儿总会流到我这儿。我不是那种创意无限的UI天才，所以专攻解决棘手问题，反而把这方面练得很熟。我倒不介意，除非遇到那种追查好久却毫无头绪的情况——既不明白为什么不行，又纳闷它以前是怎么行的。连续搞上一天确实很考验人。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah, I would say that 20% of my professional life has been creating and 80% has been debugging and fixing. And I mean, I got a bit of a reputation as somebody who could fix stuff, and so stuff like that would flow to me, and so I would spend more time doing that. I wasn't renowned as a creative UI genius where I'm flowering all these new ideas. So I got to fix ugly stuff, but you get really good at that. So I don't mind it until it's one of those things where you've been chasing it for so long that you don't know what to do next and you can't understand why it doesn't work or how it ever worked or whatever situation you happen to be in, and you know, after a day of it, it can get pretty trying.

**Lex Fridman:** 调试有时真是种折磨，特别难熬。我觉得这很考验人的心理韧性。  
**Lex Fridman:** Yeah, debugging can be real torture. It can be really, really difficult. There's a psychological component, I think, of perseverance.

**Dave Plummer:** 那些需要花一天才能解决的bug，通常有两种结局：要么是"哦，多了个分号"这种简单问题，要么就是棘手的跨线程单元问题。我遇到过一个问题——其实不是我的bug——是任务管理器偶尔会显示总CPU使用率超过100%，这看起来太滑稽了。我尝试解决了好久，也找过内核组的人，但他们不太搭理，毕竟内核工程师是特殊物种，对用户态的问题没兴趣，总觉得"肯定是你代码的问题"。  
**Dave Plummer:** I think the ones that, you know, take you a day, they resolve one of two ways. Either it's like, "Oh, extra semicolon," and then you finally see it… …Or it's some horrible manifestation of cross-threaded apartment nonsense that was really hard. But it can go both ways. I had a bug. It wasn't my bug, actually, but it was a manifestation of a bug in Task Manager where every now and then it would say greater than 100% total CPU usage, and this looks pretty silly for a task manager. So I had tried to resolve it for a long time, and I'd talked to the kernel guys about my issue, and they were unsympathetic, let's say, because the kernel guys are a special breed, and they weren't interested in my user land problems. "It's probably some issue in my code," right?

**Dave Plummer:** 他们可能通常是对的，但这次我确信不是。我在代码里加满了断言，确保累加步骤永远不会超过100，最终结果也永远不会超过100，但偶尔还是有人报告这个问题。最后我干脆在断言信息里留了我的电话号码："若见此信息，请致电DavePL，电话425-836..."。终于，在一次压力测试调试中，有人连着调试器捕获到了这个错误。  
**Dave Plummer:** And they're probably right, but it wasn't in this case, and I was sure of it, and so I kept adding asserts all through the code to make sure that the preparatory steps of adding the stuff together were never more than 100, and that the final sum was never more than 100, and finally it never asserted. But occasionally we would get this bug where people would still see it, and so I finally put my phone number in the assert, and I was like, "If you see this message, call DavePL at 425-836," my phone number. And finally, we did get a catch in the actual stress debugger that I was talking about earlier where it happened to somebody with a debugger connected.

**Dave Plummer:** 我们一步步追踪，发现确实是内核的统计问题，不是任务管理器的毛病。证明是内核问题后，他们就在内核里修复了。你可能会觉得我们该把电话号码删掉，但我们只是注释掉了——所以它随着代码一起发布了，现在所有流出的NT源码里都有这个号码……  
**Dave Plummer:** We were able to go through, and it was actually a kernel accounting issue, and it wasn't a Task Manager issue, so they just fixed it in the kernel once I was able to prove that it was in fact a kernel issue. And you'd think we would then remove my phone number, but we just commented it out, so it's shipped, and it's in all the damn source code leaks for NT that are out there, so…

**Lex Fridman:** 这故事太棒了。  
**Lex Fridman:** That's awesome.

**Dave Plummer:** ……现在我想找任务管理器代码时，就在谷歌搜自己电话号码，反向就能找到……  
**Dave Plummer:** …that's how I find Task Manager code. I search for my phone number on Google, and it will reverse-find…

**Lex Fridman:** 哈哈，这招绝了！  
**Lex Fridman:** Oh, yeah, that's fantastic.

**Dave Plummer:** ……那些NT源代码。  
**Dave Plummer:** …the NT source code.

**Lex Fridman:** 顺便问下，我好像见你在推特还是哪儿说过，要想认真对待断言，就把家里电话写进去。这招确实狠。  
Can you speak to the assert thing? By the way, I saw, I think you tweeted or you said somewhere that if you want to take your asserts really seriously, you add your home phone number in there. It's true, it's true.

**Dave Plummer:** 带点玩笑性质，虽然可能不是最明智的做法……  
**Dave Plummer:** A little facetious, because it's probably not the smartest thing, but…

**Lex Fridman:** 确实不是。  
**Lex Fridman:** No, it's not.

**Dave Plummer:** ……但效果立竿见影。  
**Dave Plummer:** …you will find out.

**Lex Fridman:** 不过断言本身就很严肃了，它会中止所有执行。这正是我特别喜欢断言的原因——它强迫你必须解决问题。  
But I mean, assert by itself is already a serious thing, because it stops all execution. I mean, this is one of the reasons I really, really love asserts, because they stop everything and force you to take care of the problem.

**Dave Plummer:** 我对断言也有点执念。我不会对"希望不成立"的事情做断言，只断言那些"绝不可能成立"的情况。我觉得这才是断言的本意。虽然像是废话，但一旦触发就肯定是bug，不是警告。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah, I'm a little religious about my asserts too. I don't assert things that I hope aren't true. I assert things that I know cannot be true, and I think that's really the intent of an assertion. So I'm overstating the obvious, but when it does occur, it's a bug, plain and simple. It's not a warning.

**Lex Fridman:** 有趣的是它总能帮你快速定位问题。只要在关键地方都加上断言，就能迅速找到根源。  
**Lex Fridman:** It's kind of fascinating how often it can really help you figure out the problem, because if you put asserts everywhere, you can get very quickly to the source of the problem.

**Dave Plummer:** 对，我不建议事后补加，而应该在构建代码时自然融入。每个函数里，如果你确信"这个指针绝不为空"，那就断言它；如果你知道这个计数绝不会超过字节宽度的两倍，也断言它。别害怕触发断言——它是在帮你。有些人就像开车出路口时觉得左边可能有车，干脆就不看左边。断言也是同理，有人怕触发就不敢用。但你应该想知道问题所在。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah, I tend to… it's not something I want to suggest you go back and add later. It's something you should do organically as you build your code. So for each function, if you've got assumptions like, "I know that this pointer is never null," well, assert that. If you know this count is always less than twice the byte width, assert that. And don't be afraid, because if it asserts, it's doing you a favor. I think some people are afraid. You know, it's like when you turn out of an intersection, and you think maybe there's somebody coming, and you don't look left. Or maybe I'm one to do that. But it's like that. People don't assert because they're afraid they're going to fire. Well, no, you want to know.

## Task Manager		
		
**Lex Fridman:** 说到任务管理器——这我们可得好好聊聊。这个传奇程序是你创造的。跟我们讲讲开发它的每个细节吧。Windows任务管理器到底是什么？  
**Lex Fridman:** You mentioned Task Manager. Obviously, we have to talk about this, the legendary program that you created, the Windows Task Manager. Tell me every detail of how you built it. What is Windows Task Manager?

**Dave Plummer:** 任务管理器就像个系统侦探，帮你找出哪些程序在占用电脑资源——CPU、内存、硬件，哪些可能消耗过多、卡死或发疯。它给你权限直接终结这些进程，本质上是个诊断和修复工具。  
**Dave Plummer:** So Windows Task Manager is a way to go in and find out which apps on your system are using the computer, using the hardware, using the CPU, using the memory, and which ones might be using too much or locked up or going crazy. And it gives you the ability to terminate and kill those ones. So it's an inspection and a fixing tool.

**Lex Fridman:** 对，它列出所有进程。这软件太传奇了，人们现在都觉得理所当然——就像开始菜单一样，简直是天才设计。  
**Lex Fridman:** Yeah, it lists all the processes. I mean, it's a legendary piece of software. It's crazy. You just take it for granted. It's like the Start menu, right? It's like genius.

**Dave Plummer:** 我很幸运参与过不少大家熟悉的项目。任务管理器属于那种"私活"——最初是写给自己用的，后来才被公司采纳。我在家完成了基础版本，当时通过注册表的HKey_Performance获取数据（因为在家没法调用内部API）。等把它带进公司后，才能用NtQuerySystemInformation这类底层接口直接获取真实数据，这让它变得极其迅捷。  
**Dave Plummer:** Well, I had the great fortune of working on a lot of things that people are familiar with. And Task Manager was one of those side projects that I started as something that I wanted for myself and eventually came in-house. So I started writing it at home and I got the basics up and running. I was using, I think it's HKey Current Performance or HKey Performance in the registry to get the stats because I didn't have access to the internal APIs because I was working from home and I don't call those if I'm working from home. And when I brought it in-house then I was able to call things like NtQuerySystemInformation or NtQueryProcessInformation and get the real answers very quickly, which enabled it to become a very fast and responsive app.

**Dave Plummer:** 人们依赖它是因为我把可靠性放在首位。功能不求花哨，但必须坚如磐石——而且体积要小。原始版本只有87KB。  
**Dave Plummer:** So people have come to rely on it because I wrote it to be as reliable as possible. I wasn't worried about the features. It was a basic set of functionality that I wanted in there. I got everything I wanted, but I wanted it to be really robust. And small. And the original was like 87k.

**Lex Fridman:** 要打造这种永远不会卡死的软件需要什么秘诀？  
**Lex Fridman:** Okay, can you speak to what it takes to build a piece of software like that that doesn't freeze?

**Dave Plummer:** 核心是"不轻信任何调用"。比如通过Shell启动程序，如果目标在网络路径上，超时可能长达90秒。所以任何可能耗时的API调用都必须放在独立线程里——这让代码更复杂，但实现了完全多线程化。  
**Dave Plummer:** You don't assume much, right? If you're going to call the shell to run an app, well, that could be a network path that's on a TCP/IP share that takes 90 seconds to time out. So anytime you do any kind of API call like that, that could take time, you're going to wind up doing it on a separate thread. And so the app becomes a little more complex because everything is multithreaded.

**Lex Fridman:** 当时用的是什么编程语言？  
**Lex Fridman:** Okay, so what programming language were you working in?

**Dave Plummer:** C++。  
**Dave Plummer:** C++.

**Lex Fridman:** 是针对Windows NT开发的？  
**Lex Fridman:** So this was for Windows NT?

**Dave Plummer:** 对，最初随NT 4.0发布。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yes. So this shipped initially in NT 4.0.

**Lex Fridman:** 这程序有哪些有趣的技术细节？既要极致简洁又要绝对可靠，你做过哪些特别优化？  
**Lex Fridman:** Okay, so what are some interesting details about this program? Because you have to get it as simple as possible, but also as robust as possible. What are some interesting optimizations, for example, you had to implement?

**Dave Plummer:** 有些做法现在看有点硬核。比如我刻意不链接C运行时库——调用任何C函数都会让体积暴涨96K，相当于翻倍。但用C++不链接运行时意味着要手动处理对象构造器调用链……虽然工作量巨大，但换来了极致的精简。  
**Dave Plummer:** There are a couple of things that are a little hardcore now. I'm surprised I did. Like, I didn't want to link to the C runtimes at all. So I made sure never to call a runtime call and I didn't link to them, and that saved me whatever the C runtime is, 96k or something. So, it almost doubled the size of the app if you just touched any C call. So I was careful not to do that, but then I was actually writing in C++, which is C with objects more than anything. But in order to get it to work, I had to go through and call all the object constructors manually from the dispatch table and stuff because you don't have the runtimes to do it for you. So you're working with a compiler that doesn't have its runtime, and I don't want to get off-topic on the technical issues, but it's a lot of extra work to get it to work, but when you do, it's incredibly small and tight.

**Lex Fridman:** 监控进程和CPU占用率的技术难点在哪里？  
**Lex Fridman:** That's about the size- of the program. What are some interesting aspects of tracking down every process and how much CPU usage is in that process?

**Dave Plummer:** 有个挺酷的实现——我后来才知道这类似汉明码的原理。任务管理器每个行列都有脏位标记，通过纵横坐标定位变化项，只重绘真正更新的单元格。结合ListView控件的增量渲染机制，即使帧率很高也能极速响应。特别是窗口缩放——这是我最得意的设计，无论怎么拉伸都保持流畅，甚至能自适应32核（当时根本不存在这种硬件）。  
**Dave Plummer:** One of the cooler things that I saw is… I don't want to say I invented Hamming code, but I kind of invented Hamming code without knowing Hamming code existed. So every column and every row in Task Manager has a bit on whether it's become dirty or not, and then I can look, basically the same way Hamming code looks in your X and Y columns, to find out which rows have changed, go through, and find out which ones actually need to be repainted. So Task Manager is super efficient and it works in concert with the ListView control, which provides that functionality to go through and repaint as little as an individual cell that changes from frame to frame. So it could paint very fast, it can resize very smoothly, and resizing was probably my biggest personal goal with that app. So you can size it to any size and it still works and even if you have 32 CPUs, which wasn't possible in the day, it will draw, I think, only eight graphs and then it wraps but it still works today. So kind of proud of that.

**Lex Fridman:** 它的演化过程很有意思。虽然界面更美观了，还加入了GPU和温度监控等新功能，但核心交互逻辑始终没变。  
**Lex Fridman:** It is incredible. You've gotten the chance to observe the evolution of Task Manager. In some ways, it really hasn't changed much. Maybe there are some prettier aspects to it that fit into whatever version of Windows it's in, but it's really basically the same thing.

**Dave Plummer:** 功能本质确实没变。新增的GPU和温度监控很实用——这些是我们当年无法实现的。至于代码……据我所知核心逻辑基本还是原来那套，只是外面裹了暗色主题、XML配置等层层新代码，让体积从87K变成了4MB——这就是时代的代价吧。  
**Dave Plummer:** The functionality is very same. The reporting is more because they've added GPU and thermals and things like that, which is really nice to have. And we didn't have that ability in the day, so… As far as I know, the original code's still mostly all there so there are layers of drawing code and dark mode code and whatever else, XML, schema code, that goes on top of that that makes it four megabytes instead of 87k but that's the world we live in, so…

**Lex Fridman:** 这种软件一旦诞生就注定永恒。就像开始菜单，如果突然消失用户肯定会疯掉。  
**Lex Fridman:** Yeah, it's one of those pieces of software you create and just stay once it's there. It's just really like the Start menu, and I'm sure if you remove it, people would just lose their mind.

**Dave Plummer:** （笑）它估计会长久存在下去。这样挺好。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah, it might be locked in for a while, on that one. It might be good.
		
## 3D Pinball: Space Cadet		
		
**3D弹珠：太空军校生**

**Lex Fridman:** 我原以为"大眼夹"也会是这样，不过说不定哪天它还真会回归。聊聊你当时参与的其他传奇软件吧？听说你参与了《太空军校生弹珠》的移植？  
**Lex Fridman:** Yeah, I thought that would be true for Clippy, but Clippy will make it back one day. All right, what are some other pieces of software you created at the time that are legendary? So you were part of Space Cadet Pinball, at least porting.

**Dave Plummer:** 当时同事来我办公室问："你在忙什么？"我说明之后，他们就说："那接下来三个月你想做什么？"我说没想法，他们便提议："要不要移植弹珠游戏？"我之前见过Win95版的《太空军校生弹珠》，里面有多种弹珠台，确实很酷，所以还挺兴奋的。他们其实是希望给NT系统加点视觉亮点，证明NT也能处理高速图形——至少是流畅的图形。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah, so they came into my office and said, "Hey, what are you doing?" And I told them what I was doing and they said, "Well, how do you want to spend your next three months?" And I said, "I have no idea." And they said, "Do you want to port Pinball?" And I'd seen Space Cadet Pinball as a game standalone for the Win95 platform and it had a couple different tables and it was a cool game so I was kind of excited. What they wanted was some visual splash for NT to show that NT can do, for then, high-speed graphics or at least responsive graphics.

**Dave Plummer:** 我接下了这个活，但麻烦的是很多代码是汇编写的，而我在MIPS架构上工作，不得不先转写成C语言才能跨平台。游戏核心是个巨大的状态机，我记得像个超大的switch语句，大概有50个分支。里面还藏了个彩蛋。解析这些状态就像让神经网络处理不同输入，我干脆把它当黑盒处理——我的代码只负责绘图、音效等上层逻辑，原始游戏逻辑保持不动。  
**Dave Plummer:** And so I took a shot, and unfortunately, a lot of the code was in Assembly, and I was on a MIPS, so I had to rewrite the code in C so that I could then port it to all the different platforms. At the heart of the game is a huge state engine, and it's like a giant switch statement with, if I remember, like 50 entries in it. And it's got an Easter egg built in. And decoding the state, it's like running a neural network through this thing as you hit it with different states. And I just put it aside and treated it as a black box. So my code runs on top of that and does the drawing and the sound and everything else. But the original game is still running.

**Dave Plummer:** 最近有人问我为什么物理效果和Win95版略有不同——我本应完全保留原代码的。后来发现是个bug：在现代电脑上游戏会以最高帧率运行，弹珠这种简单游戏能跑到5000帧/秒，导致物理计算每秒插值5000次而非原来的30次。所以物理效果确实"更好"了，但也不同了。不过这个bug后来被修复了。  
**Dave Plummer:** And somebody recently asked me why it is slightly different; the physics are slightly different from the Windows 95 version, but it should be the same code because I'm trying very hard to preserve that. But what it is, is I had a bug where I will draw as many frames per second as I can, which on a modern computer can be 5,000 frames a second for Pinball because it's a pretty basic game. And so all your physics are interpolated 5,000 times per second instead of 30 times a second, or whatever you would've got on the old one. So you're getting arguably better, or at least different physics, but they fixed that since, so…

**Lex Fridman:** 为什么这款游戏如此令人着迷？  
**Lex Fridman:** Why is that game so awesome?

**Dave Plummer:** 设计实在太出色了——这功劳完全属于Cinematronics团队。原版设计非常精妙，和我实际拥有的《黑骑士2000》弹珠机布局很像，不知道是否受其启发。总之是款经典游戏。  
**Dave Plummer:** I think it's a great design. I mean, I take no credit for that. That's all totally the guys at Cinematronics. But the original game is a great design. It's very similar to Black Knight 2000, which I own as an actual physical pinball machine. And the layout is actually very similar. I don't know if it was inspired by it or not. So it's a good game.

**Lex Fridman:** 就像俄罗斯方块，有些画面朴素的游戏却能让人沉迷。或许大众的集体热情本身就会强化游戏魅力？当越来越多人讨论它时，这种兴奋感会植入记忆。纸牌和扫雷也是——整整一代人在扫雷上"浴血奋战"过吧？  
**Lex Fridman:** Yeah. Sometimes I think about Tetris, about certain games with pretty primitive graphics that captivate the excitement of a large number of people. And maybe it's the excitement of a large number of people that contributes to the awesomeness of the game. So when many people together get excited and talk about it, that sort of gets implanted into your head. But that's one of the great games. I mean, even like Solitaire and Minesweeper. I mean, there's just a generation of people that have gone to war in Minesweeper, right?

**Dave Plummer:** 其实这些游戏被纳入系统并非作为娱乐，而是教学工具——纸牌教你拖拽操作，扫雷训练右键点击（插旗功能）。每个游戏都在潜移默化地培养用户习惯。  
**Dave Plummer:** Well, those things were included in the OS not as games, but as educational tools to get you to use a mouse. So Solitaire is there to show you how to do drag and drop. And Minesweeper's probably right-click. I think you put a flag or some item. I'm not a Minesweeper guy, but so each one of them teaches you something.

**Lex Fridman:** "扫雷高手"这个说法真有趣。我从没意识到这层设计，但确实在这些游戏上花了无数时间——全球玩家累计时长恐怕得以亿小时计。  
**Lex Fridman:** Minesweeper guy? That's funny. Yeah. Wow, I didn't know that. That's interesting. And that's true. But I don't know how many hours I've spent on these games, and millions of people have spent millions of hours on these games.

**Dave Plummer:** 我曾去孩子小学做计算机志愿教学（其实主要是教登录系统）。那里所有孩子的父亲都在微软工作，所以他们对什么都见怪不怪。但有个孩子发现我参与过弹珠游戏开发后，突然惊呼："哇！你做过弹珠台！"——那个年代的孩子都认得这游戏。现在的小朋友可能已经不知道了，但当时确实风靡一时。  
**Dave Plummer:** I used to volunteer teaching computer science at my kids' school, you know, for the third graders and stuff. So it's more like logging in than computer science. But the kids, of course, all their dads work at Microsoft, so nobody's impressed by anything you do. But so one of the kids found out I worked on Pinball, and then they were like, "Whoa, you worked on Pinball?" Because they all knew that in those days. Now the kids are probably aged out, they don't know it anymore, but for a brief period.

**Lex Fridman:** （笑）你还是Windows激活系统的幕后推手。  
**Lex Fridman:** You're behind the Windows activation.

**Dave Plummer:** 你这话说得像在指责我似的。  
**Dave Plummer:** You say it like it's a bad thing.

**Lex Fridman:** 角度问题嘛。来聊聊这段故事——Windows激活是怎么回事？你怎么参与的？  
Everything's a matter of perspective. So tell the story of that. What's Windows activation? How'd you get involved?

**Dave Plummer:** XP开发末期他们找到我（不确定是否已发布测试版）。原本计划将Office的激活代码适配到Windows，但负责人一再延期。我因为擅长快速解决问题而被选中，最终在DRM团队和密钥算法研究组的协助下，赶在XP发布前完成了这套系统。虽然不清楚具体提升多少收入，但强制验证许可证肯定意义重大。  
**Dave Plummer:** So they came to me late in the XP ship process. I don't know if the beta had gone out. I don't think the beta had gone out yet, but they had intended to take the Office activation code and then adapt it to Windows and add activation to Windows. But whoever was responsible for doing it had slipped it enough times that it wasn't going to happen. So I had kind of a reputation for being able to fix things quickly, so they came to me and said, "Can you get this done in time for XP?" "I don't know, but I'll try." So with the help of the guys that were doing the DRM stuff on the DRM side and the research guys doing the math for the product keys and everything else, we cranked it out in time for XP. And I don't know what its actual impact is for revenue, but I imagine it's substantial when you start enforcing license keys.

**Lex Fridman:** 我好奇具体数据……毕竟这功能也挺让人头疼的。  
**Lex Fridman:** I wonder what it is. Because it's also annoying.

**Dave Plummer:** 尤其是电话激活。这是我们不得不背的锅：需要向后端验证系统上传硬件参数（内存、硬盘等绑定信息）和产品密钥，还要转换成方便电话读写的字母数字组合。如果你觉得电话激活痛苦，想象一下电话那头的工作人员——每天8小时听人报密钥，这工作得多折磨人啊。  
**Dave Plummer:** It is, especially if you have to phone activate. And that was just the case that we had to carry with us as an albatross around our neck, where you've got to pass data up to the clearinghouse, the backend systems that are going to approve your key. You've got to tell it all your hardware parameters, like how much memory and hard drive space and the various things the hardware key is bound to, as well as the product key, and you've got it encoded in letters and numbers that somebody's willing to read in over a phone. And if you think doing product activation is painful over the phone, could you imagine being the person that worked on the other end of that line? I mean, that's just got to be a mind-numbing job to listen to product keys for eight hours a day.

## Start menu and taskbar		
		
**## 开始菜单与任务栏**

**Lex Fridman:** 说实话，Windows 有个让我挺头疼的地方——虽然从设计角度能理解它的难处，毕竟用户群体太庞大了。但这些年它越来越偏离高级用户的需求，这也是为什么 Linux 一直让我觉得舒心。不管是激活机制还是各种配置选项，Windows 确实给人不少挫败感。  
**Lex Fridman:** Yeah, one of the challenges with Windows, and it's been a frustration point for me, but I understand from a design perspective it's very difficult, is so many different kinds of people use Windows. But it's been frustrating how over time Windows has more and more leaned into the direction of not the power user, I should say, which is why Linux has always been really wonderful. But from an activation perspective or from any kind of configuration, it's been a source of a lot of frustration.

**Dave Plummer:** 最近我有个视频挺火，讲的是为什么不能移动 Windows 任务栏。没想到大家的怨气这么强烈——  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah, one of my more popular episodes of late has been why you can't move the Windows taskbar. And I had no idea, but the outrage is palpable amongst people that you—

**Lex Fridman:** 对！就是这个！  
**Lex Fridman:** Yes.

**Dave Plummer:** ——现在不能把它放在左侧或顶部，对某些用户来说简直是侵犯人权。某种程度上我能理解这种感受。  
**Dave Plummer:** …just put it on the left or top and you can't anymore, and it is an affront to their existence. And I understand it to a certain extent.

**Lex Fridman:** 这也是我不太喜欢 Windows 的主要原因之一。Windows 11 有很多让我不满的地方，比如任务栏位置这种基础定制功能都被限制了。为什么不能多给用户点配置自由？只要给高级用户这个选项，他们就会爱死这个系统——这根本不需要什么成本啊。  
**Lex Fridman:** Well, it's one of the main reasons I really just dislike Windows. There's a lot of aspects about Windows 11 I dislike. One of which is like you can't customize things as much about the position of the taskbar, just basic customization. Can we just configure stuff? Because there's going to be a small contingent of power users that are just going to enjoy the hell out of this operating system if you just give them that option. It costs you nothing. Just give them that freedom.

**Dave Plummer:** 其实是有成本的。允许开始菜单放在左、上、右各个位置，会大幅增加渲染代码的复杂性——标签布局、交互逻辑都要适配不同方位，这意味着更多的 bug 风险和更重的维护负担，可能需要投入额外开发资源。虽然决策权不在我，但我理解双方的立场。  
**Dave Plummer:** Well, it does cost, right? Because the freedom to put the Start menu on the left or the top or the right really increases the complexity of the code that renders the Start menu and lays out the tabs and does all the things, and now it's a much larger surface for bugs and it's a much larger piece of code to maintain, so you probably need more developers or another developer or some portion of a developer's time. So the question becomes at what point is it still worth it to satisfy the niche needs of a small set of users? Those decisions weren't mine to make, but I could see it from both sides.

**Lex Fridman:** 就像电影里埋的彩蛋，虽然只有少数人能发现，但这种用心会积累成口碑效应。对招聘优秀工程师也很有帮助——大家会认为这是个连细节都用心打磨的地方。微软收购 GitHub 后确实更关注开发者了，但在界面定制方面……拜托，多给点自由吧。VS Code 什么都能定制，为什么开始菜单反而不行？  
**Lex Fridman:** I think just like the people who make movies and insert very nuanced details that only a small number of people will realize are there, that's going to really pay off. There's a kind of reputation that builds over time that has a very powerful ripple effect. That I think it has so many benefits, including for hiring great software engineers. It's like you create this aura of a place that puts love into every detail, that really takes care of the power users, that takes care of the developers, and I think Microsoft has more and more moved in that direction with GitHub and acquiring GitHub and just taking care of the developers. But on the Windows interface side, come on, some customization. With VS Code, you can customize everything. Why can't we customize the Start menu, all right? And the taskbar, and really every aspect of the Windows interface. I don't know, maybe you're right. Maybe it increases the complexity of the code. I suspect that's just not the case.

**Dave Plummer:** 我猜是进度压力导致的。重写开始菜单时，项目经理可能算过：如果砍掉左右顶部布局、多行标签等复杂功能，能提前四个月交付。这不一定是正确决定，但很可能是现实考量。而且现在发布周期太短了——除非有人长期负责一个组件并不断打磨，否则很难做出精品。虽然现在界面看起来不错，但……  
**Dave Plummer:** I bet it was. I bet it was a scheduling decision when they rewrote the Start menu. I think they rewrote it because it's different than the old taskbar. And somebody was tasked with, "You've got to deliver this set of functionality, and if I cut out putting it on the left and the top and the right and two rows of tabs and all the other cool features, I can deliver it four months sooner." And I'm not saying that's the right decision, but I'm guessing that might be the kind of thing that motivates it. And they're on such a different release schedule now. It used to be… You won't see much craftsmanship unless somebody owns a component for a long time and it settles to a point that then you can work on and polish it, right? But if it's always churning and the UI is changing every release, it's never going to get that level of polish. Although I think the UI is pretty nice, but…

**Lex Fridman:** 这就是工艺精神的问题。就像你开发任务管理器那样，如果有人真正拥有主导权，带着热情去打磨，短时间内就能创造出精彩的东西。大团队管理确实会受制于流程，但 Google 就很擅长让员工发展个人项目——  
**Lex Fridman:** Yeah, it is nice, but I think it's a craftsmanship thing. Just like you with the Task Manager, if there's a guy or a girl in there who takes ownership of it, who has a passionate… For them, it's a thing that they take pride in over a period of time, they can by themselves in a short amount of time create something truly wonderful. And like, I think if you have large software engineering teams with managers and scheduling of meetings and all this kind of stuff, yeah, okay. Then your argument applies. But if you allow the flourishing of individuals that create cool stuff and their own sort of side project, which Google is very good at.

**Dave Plummer:** Google 确实尝试过这种模式。  
**Dave Plummer:** They've tried that, right? At Google, yeah.

**Lex Fridman:** 让开发者尽情发挥创意，再整合到生态中。要知道，当你开发的任务栏定制功能被数百万用户使用，甚至被成千上万开发者深度定制时，那种成就感是无与伦比的。  
**Lex Fridman:** Yeah, like have fun with it. Like do some crazy stuff and then we'll integrate it. We'll try to integrate it into the whole ecosystem. I don't know. I don't know, because to me, it's such a great joy for an individual developer to create something like customization of the Start menu or the taskbar because you know that millions of people are going to use the taskbar. And then you know that thousands, tens of thousands of developers might be using to customize even little subtle aspects of the taskbar. You know how much joy you create, you give to people to customize, to have some kind of JSON thing where you customize something about the taskbar?

**Dave Plummer:** 但你怎么看待乔布斯式的观点：提供定制选项意味着我们没能力为你找到最佳方案？  
**Dave Plummer:** Okay, but how do you respond to the Steve Jobs aspect of giving you customization implies that we couldn't figure out the right answer for you? Or maybe there is no right answer and all four answers are equally right. I have no idea, but…

**Lex Fridman:** 苹果的存在很有价值，那种设计哲学很美妙。但 Windows 的意义在于创造对比——它是为各种设备设计的开放系统。随着 WSL 等功能的推出，微软越来越注重开发者生态，界面设计也应该顺应这种精神。不过确实，开放定制可能带来安全隐患，Windows 面临的攻击压力已经够大了。  
**Lex Fridman:** Right. I think I've always— I'm glad Apple exists. It's a beautiful thing, and that idea of design is wonderful, but I always thought that Windows creates the contrast. The point of Windows is to be the operating system that works on all kinds of devices, that's supposed to be much more open. And they've moved towards that direction more and more with Windows Subsystem for Linux. It's just this whole developer-friendly ecosystem. The interface should be in the spirit of that, I think. But I do think that there could also be security vulnerabilities created with that. It's not just the complexity of the code, because Windows is just under attack. It's very difficult to keep it secure.

**Lex Fridman:** 话说回来，你还开发了 Windows 的 ZIP 文件支持功能，创造了 Visual ZIP，后来演变成系统自带的 ZIP 文件夹。聊聊这个故事吧。  
Anyway, taking that tangent, you also developed ZIP file support for Windows, creating Visual ZIP, which eventually evolved into ZIP folders. Tell the story of that.

**Dave Plummer:** 这又是我在家鼓捣的副业。1993 年有个周日下午，我和妻子开车看房时见到一栋漂亮的三居室，车道上停着辆 93 款红色科尔维特敞篷车，总价 30 万美元——我当时根本负担不起。我把房源广告上的房子照片剪下来贴显示器上，每晚写代码时就看着它激励自己。一方面是想释放白天修 bug 无法满足的创造力，另一方面也想赚点外快。  
**Dave Plummer:** So that was a piece of software that I wrote at home again, and what happened was, I was out with my wife, and I think it was a Sunday afternoon. We were driving around. This is 1993, and we're living in our apartment, and we're just seeing what the housing market is like out there. And there's a guy, he's got this beautiful three-bedroom house and a Corvette convertible, '93 red, torch red, parked in the driveway, and the house is for sale, and it's like 300K, I think. And there's no chance I'm coming up with 300K at that point, or even the down payment on that. So I took the flyer, and I cut the picture of the house out, and I taped it to my monitor. And that was my incentive to just write something at night, because when I came home, I was doing two things. I was, one, expressing a creativity that I couldn't get out at work when I was just fixing bugs, and I was trying to make some extra money.

**Dave Plummer:** 我基于 MSDN 的示例代码写了个 Shell 扩展，这也是后来我主动申请加入 Shell 团队的原因。有了基础框架后，逐步添加 ZIP 支持就水到渠成了。我以共享软件形式发布，定价 19.95 或 29.95 美元，卖了几百到几千份。有一天早上我正准备上班，接到个电话："是 Dave Plummer 吗？你是 Visual ZIP 的作者吗？我是微软的 Betsy，想约你谈谈收购事宜。"我问她在哪栋楼，打算直接过去，她却说要先联系法务和差旅部门——聊了几分钟才发现，她根本不知道我就在微软上班。  
**Dave Plummer:** And so I wrote a Shell extension. Before I actually went to the Shell team, I started it, and that's what led to my interest in going to the Shell team, based on an MSDN sample or MSJ at the time, an MSJ sample that I saw on how to, like, bring up a folder. Well, once I had the very basic bring up a folder template, adding ZIP file support to it was just incremental all the way. And I released it as a shareware product. I think it was 19.95 or 29.95, and I sold, whatever, a couple of hundreds or thousands of copies. And one day, I'm getting ready for work, and I get a call, and it's a lady, and she says, "Are you Dave Plummer?" I said, "Yeah." She said, "Are you the guy that wrote Visual ZIP?" I said, "Yeah." And she said, "Well, this is Betsy from Microsoft, and we'd like you to come by and come in and talk about an acquisition of it." And I said, "Okay, what building are you in?" And she's like, "What do you mean?" And I said, "Well, I'll come by." And she said, "Well, no, you got to talk to travel, and you got to talk to legal, and this all has to be set up." And I'm like, "I don't get it. We both work at the same place." Why can't I just stop by?" I don't know if I said that literally— …but it was a few minutes of back and forth where we both realized that she didn't know I worked there.

**Lex Fridman:** （笑）这太有意思了。  
**Lex Fridman:** Yeah, that's funny.

**Dave Plummer:** 他们是直接联系作者，结果发现就是我。最后我接受了收购要约，买了辆二手的 93 款红色科尔维特……  
**Dave Plummer:** They had just cold-called the author and then found out that it was me. And so they made me an offer on it, and it's the kind of thing where if I don't accept the offer, well, now my choices are: I can keep selling my own version and quit Microsoft, or I can stop selling my own version and work for Microsoft. Neither of those is great. I mean, I'd like to keep my job, of course, but I'd like to still— …have this income stream. And the other option was accept their offer, which is what I did. So then I bought a used '93 red Corvette, and…

**Lex Fridman:** 之后你还在内部继续开发这个功能？  
And you got to continue building it internally?

**Dave Plummer:** 对，但删减了不少功能。比如当时加密技术属于军用品管制，不能随意添加到系统组件中，多卷压缩支持也为了简化而移除。  
**Dave Plummer:** I did. So we took a lot of features out, right, to simplify, because it had encryption, and it had a number of features that were common in ZIP programs of the day, but probably weren't appropriate for Windows. And, at the time, encryption was like a munition, so you couldn't just add encryption willy-nilly to various parts of the operating system, so we took out some things like that. Multi-volume support, I think, was taken out just to simplify it.

**Lex Fridman:** 能聊聊 ZIP 格式的历史和压缩技术吗？  
Can you speak to ZIP in general, just the history of ZIP and, you know, compression, that whole thing?

**Dave Plummer:** 它诞生于 BBS 时代，人们用调制解调器下载共享软件时需要压缩传输。Phil Katz 开发的 MS-DOS 命令行工具 PKZIP 成为行业标准，虽然他本人结局比较悲剧。到 Windows 时代，用户已经积累了十年的 ZIP 文件，系统原生支持就成了刚需。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah, it was really borne out of the BBS era when people were dialing in on modems to download trialware and shareware and other things from BBSs online and to compress them. Executables compressed about half their size. Other stuff compresses much more. But a guy named Phil Katz came up with a command-line program for MS-DOS called PKZIP, which was able to do compression of programs, and he has a rather tragic arc. But it became ubiquitous in the entire PC industry, and pretty much everybody was using it. So when Windows came out, there was no way to open up a ZIP file, but everybody had been creating them for a decade, and so that really drove the desire to have the ZIP support right in Windows.

**Lex Fridman:** 这也是个经久不衰的软件啊。  
**Lex Fridman:** Yeah, and that's another piece of software that's just kind of with us to this day.

**Dave Plummer:** 嗯，虽然现在还有很大优化空间——它诞生于单核时代，不支持多线程。就算你用 96 核的线程撕裂者，解压时也只会用到其中一个核心。  
**Dave Plummer:** Mm-hmm. And it could be vastly improved, but, you know, it was written in the single-core days, so it doesn't do anything multi-threaded. And you've got a 96-core 7995, well, it uses one of them to unzip your file.

**Lex Fridman:** 你在微软还参与过哪些厉害的项目？  
**Lex Fridman:** What other awesome things were you a part of at Microsoft? What other pieces of software?

**Dave Plummer:** 我参与过 Windows Media Center 的初期原型开发。96 年那会儿还没有信号源，我们只能用光盘播放《狂暴鲁道夫》和《南方公园》圣诞特别篇的 MPEG 文件——放现在职场肯定不合适了。后来在楼顶装了卫星天线，慢慢做出了 Media Center 的雏形，这是为远距离操作设计的界面，让你能用遥控器在客厅使用 Windows。现在的开始菜单在 20 英尺外根本没法看。  
**Dave Plummer:** I worked on the initial prototypes of Windows Media Center. So we did— …that in '96, I believe. And we didn't have, at the time, any sources, so we had like a CD of MPEG video files of Raging Rudolph and I think the original South Park video— …the Christmas one, which is all wildly inappropriate in the workplace today, but— it's all the content we had until we got actually… We had them put a satellite dish on the roof, a DSS, whatever the 18-inch dish is, because we couldn't get cable to the building. And so we built up this thing that would eventually look a lot like Media Center, and it was distance viewing UI for Windows, so you could sit with a remote control on a desktop and have, you know… The current Start menu is not great at 20 feet away.
## Blue Screen of Death		
		
**蓝屏死机**

**Lex Fridman:** 聊聊那个臭名昭著的蓝屏死机吧。  
**Lex Fridman:** Tell me the story of the infamous blue screen of death.

**Dave Plummer:** 蓝屏本质上是Windows在无路可走时的最后手段。当内核遇到无法处理的错误——比如设备驱动试图写入不属于它的内存，或者重复释放同一块内存——系统会选择关机来避免更大损失。它会显示蓝屏并输出堆栈信息（取决于设置），现在的新版本可能只显示个悲伤表情。  
**Dave Plummer:** What it is is when Windows has no other option, when the kernel gets into a state where something illegal has happened, so let's say a device driver is trying to write to a piece of memory it doesn't own or is trying to free a piece of memory twice, something that just cannot happen, and the kernel has no other option, it will shut the machine down to save your work. And… Well, not save, but prevent further damage, and it puts up a blue screen and it prints out the stack information, depending how your settings are. Sometimes it's just a sad face. In the current Windows.

**Lex Fridman:** 最早出现蓝屏的是哪个Windows版本？  
**Lex Fridman:** I wonder what the first version of Windows when the blue screen came to be.

**Dave Plummer:** Windows 3确实有蓝屏，但和NT系列的蓝屏完全不是一回事。我问过NT蓝屏的设计者Jon Viert，为什么选白字蓝底。一直有传言说是因为实验室里几十台电脑同时跑压力测试时，蓝屏特别显眼。但真相更简单：他当时用的MIPS固件和Visual SlickEdit编辑器都是这个配色。这样编码、启动、崩溃、重启全程色调统一。  
**Dave Plummer:** So, Windows 3 had a blue screen- but it's completely unrelated to the blue screen in Windows NT. And I talked to the guy who wrote the blue screen in Windows NT. His name's Jon Viert, and the reason he picked white on blue, I had thought, I'd always heard it was because in the labs, you could walk through a lab where we have 50 PCs all running stressed. "Oh, that one's got a blue screen. It's—" "crashed." It wasn't that simple. It was just the MIPS firmware that he was building it on was blue on white, and Visual SlickEdit that he was using as an editor was also the same color scheme. And so you could code, boot, crash, and reboot, all in the same color scheme.

**Lex Fridman:** 为什么电脑问题总能用"重启解决"？  
**Lex Fridman:** Why do you think so many problems with computers can be solved by turning it off and turning it back on again?

**Dave Plummer:** 长时间运行后主要出两个问题：一是内存泄漏，资源逐渐被耗尽；二是程序进入开发者未预料的状态。重启能同时解决这两类问题——既清理了内存，又让所有程序回到初始状态。  
**Dave Plummer:** I think there's two major things that happen with computers as you run them over time. One is memory gets used and not freed. And so it accumulates on the heap or in the swap file or wherever, and things get sluggish. And the other is, code gets into a state that the developers didn't anticipate or didn't test very well. And maybe that's a rare state, but now that Notepad or Word or Excel is in that state, your system is goofy. So if you just reboot the thing or shut it down or restart it, you're getting a fresh state and there are no memory leaks, so it covers a lot of sins, basically.

**Lex Fridman:** 而且多个异常程序相互影响会产生"复合异常"，导致整个系统行为诡异。你在微软期间见过最好和最烂的代码分别是怎样的？  
And the intricate ways that several pieces of software in a goofy state interact with each other creates sort of a meta goofy state that just the entire system starts acting a little weird. And then somehow fixes it. What are some of the best and the worst code you've seen during that time at Microsoft? What's some beautiful code and what's some ugly code that pops to memory?

## Best programmers		
		
**Dave Plummer:** 说到优雅的代码，有两类让我印象深刻。其一是内核代码——当你深入Windows内核的NT API层面，会发现它们的编写标准远高于用户态代码。而在用户态方面，最让我惊叹的是Bob Day写的命名管道实现。他为了避免使用共享内存（在NT上共享内存是糟糕的设计），发明了这套机制。我记得代码审查时看他的实现，那种精妙程度让我感叹："就算让我专门研究可能也写不出来。"  
**Dave Plummer:** In terms of beautiful code, there's two that stand out for me. One is the kernel in general. When you get down into the Windows kernel- …in the actual NT APIs and stuff, it's very well written, and it's written to a standard that you don't see on the user side, or at least is uncommon on the user side. On the user side, probably the coolest code I remember seeing was a guy named Bob Day, who wrote a named pipe implementation to eliminate the use of shared memory. So Windows 95 had a big shared segment amongst all the shell processes where it would store stuff that was common to all the shells. We didn't want to do that. Shared memory is a bad idea on NT at an industrial level, so he came up with a way to do it with named pipes, and I remember doing a code review on it, and it was very impressive to walk through the code. It was one of those things where it was like, "Oh, I don't think I could have done that if I was trying."

**Lex Fridman:** 你遇到过最厉害的程序员是谁？  
**Lex Fridman:** Who's the greatest programmer you've ever encountered?

**Dave Plummer:** 其实没有所谓"最厉害"的，但我有个印象深刻的故事。刚入职六周时，我在做OLE演示缓存项目，遇到调度器死锁问题。当时我对x86汇编还不熟，只能硬着头皮看Windows调度器代码。实在搞不定后，我给Win95内核团队发邮件求助。十分钟后，一位工程师拿着串口线进来——虽然我的调试环境已经搭好了。她熟练使用WinDbg（那个难用的调试器），快速查看内核对象状态，分析线程等待关系。整个调试过程如行云流水，五分钟后只听她说"明白了"，然后就离开了。这位就是后来成为微软杰出工程师的Laura Butler。她为我树立了微软工程师的标杆——无论是调试能力还是专业素养。  
**Dave Plummer:** You know what? I don't think there is any one. I've met a number of great programmers, but I'll tell you one story that impressed me a lot. When I was brand new at the company, I'd been there like six weeks, and I'm working on this OLE Presentation Cache that I'd mentioned earlier. And I'm on Windows 95, and I've got Excel inserted into Word, and I'm in the kernel debugger, and something's going wrong in the scheduler. And I've been there, you know, I've barely written any x86 code, and I'm looking at the Windows scheduler, trying to figure out why my thing is deadlocked. And eventually, I get stuck, so I'm kind of out of my element, and I send an email to the Windows 95 kernel team and say, "Could you send somebody by?" So about 10 minutes later, this developer strolls in, and they're just holding a null modem cable, which is to connect my two machines together so they can debug one with the other in case I didn't have it, but it was already set up. And so they sit down, and they're using WinDbg, which is a horrible debugger. It's just accursed. But they're very, very competent with it, and they are just blasting through the call stacks, and they're checking all these objects in the kernel and trying to find out who's waiting on what and why things are deadlocked, and what things are signaled and what's not. And it's just this quicksilver ballet of call stacks flying by, and I'm watching this, and I'm pretty blown away because I'm a good programmer, but this person is an amazing debugger, and I've never seen a performance like this. And about five minutes in, I just hear, "Oh, I see." And then they disconnected and got up and left. And that was Laura Butler, who became a distinguished engineer at Microsoft. I think she may still be; I'm not sure if she's retired or not, but… So she kind of set my template for, you know, what Microsoft developers were like when they're debugging and what kernel developers were like, and even what female developers were like, because I had such a small sample set. But it was a very high standard, so…

**Lex Fridman:** 我特别欣赏那些在底层工程领域做到极致的人。比如维护大型计算基础设施的专家——他们就像魔术师一样令人惊叹。这就像观看大师级木匠工作，或者看到数百万人每日使用的桥梁，那种人类协作创造的成就感。软件的影响虽然不那么直观，但想象一下Linux和开源系统影响的人数，还有任务管理器——每月20亿用户量级，这太疯狂了。  
**Lex Fridman:** There are few things I love in life more than people who are ultra-competent at anything, really. But the lower level, the better, in the engineering space. They're able to, for example, run or maintain the computer infrastructure. So not the individual computer, but the computers communicating and working together. Those people are just magicians. It's so inspiring to make… It's like watching a great carpenter or… I love anything done really, really well. Yeah, it's beautiful to see. It's beautiful to see that humans are able to accomplish that. Even in civil engineering, when I look at bridges, it's like the number of people that had to come together to build that, and now millions of people use it every single day. With software, sometimes you don't get to see visually just the number of people impacted by a thing. So imagine how many people are impacted by Linux and all the different open-source systems that make up Linux. It's incredible. And Task Manager is an example of a piece of software. Just how many people have used that over the years, and how many times? It's crazy. It's probably, is it billions? Billions have used that.

**Dave Plummer:** 是的，每月大约20亿。最让我着迷的是，当你设计一个复杂系统时，先在脑中构建完整的运行逻辑，然后通过代码将其实现，最终这个脑中的构想能在数十亿设备上运行——这种成就感无关虚荣，而是对技术影响力的敬畏。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah, two billion a month or something. Two billion? Something like that. I've seen the metrics, and it's up there. Oh, crazy to think. It is. What I love about it, though, and I'm sure you've had this experience, where sometimes you design a piece of software, and it's complex, and you get it working in your head, and you get the plumbing working, and you know how it's going to run and flow, and then eventually you write the code, and the code does that thing that you had pictured in your head. And now there are billions of copies of that thing that I had in my head running on billions of people and machines, and that in itself is really cool to me. It's not a vanity thing so much as I'm impressed by it, I guess.

**Lex Fridman:** 这些年来你的编程风格有什么演变？  
**Lex Fridman:** How's your programming evolved over the years?

**Dave Plummer:** 现在我会更谨慎地控制复杂度。过去习惯先写代码再重构，现在则先搭建清晰的框架再填充细节。因为见过太多项目因代码混乱而无法维护，前期投入的精力最终会得到回报。  
**Dave Plummer:** I take a lot more care with complexity these days. So it used to be you would write code and just keep writing code, writing code, and then at some point, go back and clean it up. Well, I write the other way now. I try to write really clean initial skeletal code and then flesh it out because I have been involved in too many projects of my own and of other people's making where things get so messed up that they're just not fixable. And so sometimes the work you put in upfront pays off, you know?

**Lex Fridman:** 你主要使用哪些编程语言？  
**Lex Fridman:** What programming languages have you used over the years? What's been your main go-tos?

**Dave Plummer:** 主要是C++和汇编。虽然最近有个副项目在用Lua和Python。  
**Dave Plummer:** For me, it's been C++ and assembly language. And still to this day, C++ is really what you lean on? Yeah, right now I'm 100% Lua and Python, but that's just a side project I'm working on.

**Lex Fridman:** 能聊聊为什么转向Lua和Python，以及你钟爱C++的原因吗？  
Can you speak to the Lua and the Python detour that you took, and what do you love about C++?

**Dave Plummer:** 我在开发一个玩《Tempest》的AI——这是款1980年的3D矢量游戏，我保持着它的世界纪录。我先逆向工程了游戏ROM，分析内存布局和变量位置，然后用Lua提取游戏运行时数据，通过Socket传给Python端进行强化学习（使用Dueling Deep-Q网络）。目前AI能玩到36关，远超普通人类水平。  
**Dave Plummer:** What I'm doing is I wanted to build an AI to play the game Tempest. That's the old Atari game, Tempest. This is a game that I actually hold the world record on. So it's a 3D vector game from 1980. And it's a very complex game. You've got full 360 degrees of motion, you have eight shots on the screen, there are like 11 enemies, there are spikes. So it's a very complex game. It's not like trying to do Pong or something. And what I wound up doing was first taking the ROMs out of the machine and reverse engineering the code. So I got a sense of where all the code in Tempest lives and what it does, where the zero-page variables are, where things live. And yeah, there's one. So long story short, it's a fairly complicated game to play well, and I wanted to see if I could get an AI to do it. So once I had figured out where all the interesting parts of the game lived in memory, I added them as parameters and built a Lua app to extract everything from the game's memory as it's running and puts them together as parameters, which sends it to the Python side over a socket, and then the Python side does RL learning. I'm using a dueling Deep-Q, and I believe… Two with two head and tail, and they chase each other and it can play up to about level 36 now, which is way better than most humans. But that's level 96, so it's got a ways to go yet.

**Lex Fridman:** （看着游戏画面）你是控制这个红色物体射击？操作只有顺时针/逆时针旋转和射击？  
And you're the red thing shooting? Yes. You're controlling the red thing that's shooting? Okay. What are the options? You can just move clockwise or counterclockwise and then you could shoot.

**Dave Plummer:** 对，通过光学旋转编码器控制方向，加上射击键和紧急清屏的"超级 zap"键。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah, so you have a rotating knob- …which is an optical spinner, and you have a fire button and a super zapper for emergencies. But that's it. Fire and rotate, basically.

**Lex Fridman:** 回到C++——你为什么多年来一直偏爱它？  
All right, let's get back to your favorite C++. What do you love about C++? Why have you stayed with it for all these years?

**Dave Plummer:** 因为它能让我用类来封装最爱的C代码。其实我主要写两种风格的C++：一种是现代C++20，避免使用指针和C风格字符串，安全性堪比Rust；另一种是"C with classes"，在标准C基础上加入多态和封装。  
**Dave Plummer:** Because it allows me to encapsulate my favorite C code in classes. I'm not a big- Well, I actually- Yeah, I'm really a C guy. Although I write two kinds of C++. I write really modern C++ 20 using no pointers, no strings, or no character strings, so there are… you know, it's basically as safe as Rust as far as I'm concerned. Or I write C with classes, which is standard C, but, you know, with polymorphism and encapsulation. That's most of what my code is, but I try to do both.
## Scariest time of Dave’s life		
		
**## 人生中最恐惧的时刻**

**Lex Fridman:** 我们来聊聊之前跳过的那段经历。你在微软期间和之后开发了很多软件，其中一家公司Software Online似乎因为过度催促用户升级而惹上了麻烦？这听起来像是每个独立开发者的噩梦——一边是创业的热情，一边是现实的规则。能说说这段经历和你的收获吗？  
**Lex Fridman:** Let me ask you about the whole stretch of time that we kind of skipped over. You built a lot of software over the years after Microsoft, on the side while at Microsoft and afterwards, a lot of successful pieces of software. One of your companies was Software Online, and it got into trouble for nagging users too much, I guess- … to upgrade. That's what I saw. What was all that about and what did you learn from that experience?

**Dave Plummer:** （神情认真）除了孩子生病那种揪心的时刻，这确实是我人生中最恐惧的经历。但有趣的是，事发前那段时间却充满激情：当时我的共享软件卖得不错，有天尝试网络横幅广告，忘记设置金额上限。周一发现竟花了1万美元广告费时，我脑子里嗡的一声：该怎么跟妻子解释这个失误？但看到3.8万美元的销售额时，那种从谷底翻腾而上的感觉至今难忘。可就在准备大干一场时，州检察长的起诉书来了。最让我难以接受的是，12项指控中有10项明显不实。作为自闭症患者，这种"莫须有"的指控让我陷入极大的认知冲突——为什么我们要讨论这些根本不存在的事？  
**Dave Plummer:** That was… Other than, like, family health scares, you know, when kids are sick, that was the scariest time of my life. And the period leading up to it was one of the most invigorating and exciting, because what had happened was while I was at Microsoft, I had written all these shareware utilities and I was selling them on the side and sold one to Microsoft, as we talked about, and they started to do really well. And then I discovered banner advertising online. So I signed up with my credit card for a site, I think it was called Fast Click, and you could say, "I will pay this much for a banner ad impression. Here's my banner." And it would rotate it in. And I didn't set a cap on it. I came back on Monday and I saw I had spent like $10,000 in banner ads. I was like, "Holy crap. How am I going to explain this to my wife? This is a bug, it's a mistake, it was my fault." And I looked at the sales and it had made like $38,000 worth of sales. And I was like, "Holy cow. So all I have to do is scale that at some point," and basically did that for the next several years. And the reason we got in trouble was the AG came in and they had… well, I was blown away because they had like 12 court claims of action and 10 of them were outrageous, which to me as a person with autism, I couldn't get past. It's like, I know these 10 things are absolutely not true. Why are we even here talking about them? And then all they care are the two things that might be true.

**Dave Plummer:** （语气缓和）其实争议的核心很单纯：30天试用期后，如果用户继续使用未购买版本，软件每天会提醒一次——不是每十分钟，就像个礼貌的邻居轻轻敲门。但检察长认为这属于骚扰。最后我们同意改为每周提醒一次，并增加一键卸载功能。另一个问题现在看来很怀旧：2001年时，即使在线购买软件，用户也期待收到实体光盘。我们默认勾选"邮寄光盘"选项（额外收费3.95或4.95美元），是因为不这样做会收到大量投诉——那个年代的人们对"虚拟商品"还没有完全信任。这种时代隔阂造成的误会，现在想来反而有些温暖。  
**Dave Plummer:** And the two things that might be true were that it was a 30-day trial version, and after your 30 days were up, it would then, if you continued to run it and not buy it or uninstall it, it would remind you once a day. Not like every 10 minutes, but once a day or every time you booted your computer, but most once a day. And the AG contended that that was too often; it amounted to spam. And so we agreed with them to limit it to once a week, I believe. And, you know, there had to be a button to just uninstall with one click. So we did those kinds of things. The other one was, in those days, when somebody bought a piece of software, even if they bought it online and got a download, they fully expected there would be media showing up at their house. So in the year 2001, which were 2001-2003 we're talking about, if you bought software, there was an expectation that a disc would show up. And so we made that the default, was to fulfill by disc and it was $3.95 or $4.95 extra, and it was very obvious, but it was a checkbox and it was turned on to ship the disc to your house. Because we found if we didn't do that, we got all these calls, people would wait, they'd order, two weeks later call, "Where's my disc?" And we'd look, "Oh, you didn't order a disc." "Well, cancel it all. I don't want it because I'm not waiting for it." And so we got a lot of returns and we didn't include the disc, and so we decided to include the disc, but that is an a priori violation of negative affirmation billing in Washington State because you're giving them a default higher purchase price.

**Lex Fridman:** 这引出了软件与用户关系的核心问题：如何把握提醒的频率？就像人与人之间的相处，完全不提醒可能让用户错过真正需要的功能，过度提醒又会变成唠叨。这种微妙的平衡，是不是也反映了技术产品中的人性化思考？  
**Lex Fridman:** What about the software user relationship? It's interesting, like, how often to annoy the user with a thing. Right? If you never mention anything, they might never discover something they actually want. But if you mention it too much, then they can get annoyed.

**Dave Plummer:** （微笑）关键是要让用户感受到尊重。就像好的朋友关系，你可以给出建议，但不能强迫对方接受。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah. And what you don't want is you don't want them to have to do it or buy it or do something to get rid of it.

**Lex Fridman:** 现在的Windows也有类似问题。比如我特别反感用微软账户登录系统，但现在几乎无法绕过。整个流程感觉像在诱导用户放弃原本意图——我得反复点击"跳过"和确认提示。这种设计虽然能提升转化率，但从长期看损害了用户信任。就像一段关系中，如果总是试图操控对方，最终会失去真诚的连接。  
**Lex Fridman:** That's one of the things that bothers me with… I think Windows does that a little bit still to this day, where it bothers me by asking me certain questions, like, "Do you want this?" For example, I really don't like to use my Microsoft account to log into Windows. I think now it's basically required. I think there's just no way around it. But they make it so difficult to not do that. It's almost like they think they can just trick me into… It really does feel like I'm getting tricked into not doing what I want to do. It's… I have to, like, think, "Okay, I need to click skip," and then it'll do something, "Are you sure?" Like, I have to use too much of my brain to do the thing I need… As an interface, you know what I'm trying to do. You're trying to trick me into not doing the thing I want to do. And what I hate about that is, like… It's probably effective, sure, for converting people, but it's really not good long-term for taking care of the interests of the user.

**Dave Plummer:** （若有所思）最典型的是"使用推荐设置"选项。听起来很合理，就像朋友说"相信我，这样对你好"，但实际会重置你的浏览器为Edge等配置。这种"为你好"的预设，反而让人感到被冒犯。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah, the one that really throws me is the user recommended settings. So I just did a Windows upgrade, I went through the steps, and, you know, I'm going through this new dialog or wizard, and "use recommended settings" sounds like the thing you should do, but I'm pretty sure that resets you to using the Edge browser and… …And all this other stuff. So yeah, recommended by them, but not recommended for me. And that's the difficulty.

**Lex Fridman:** 这种强制默认浏览器的策略真能赢得用户忠诚度吗？就像人际关系中，靠小聪明获取的顺从终会露出破绽。其实Edge本身是个优秀浏览器，但这种操作让人产生不信任感。技术产品与用户之间，是否也应该建立像朋友间的坦诚相待？  
**Lex Fridman:** That's a really good example. What effect do you think that does in resetting the default browser to Edge? Do you think you're going to really earn the loyalty of a user if you do that? Don't you think that there are actually… What you're going to create… You're going to create some passive loyalty from some user base, so on the metrics, it might actually look like you've increased the number of Edge users, but really, it's that reputation hit you take over time where it just forms where the Edge is the thing that you can't quite trust. Unfairly, because I think Edge is a really great browser, but just this unpleasant feeling. I don't know what that is, and…

**Dave Plummer:** （轻声）谁希望自己的操作系统像个精于算计的销售员呢？好的技术应该像值得信赖的老友，在需要时默默支持，而不是时刻盘算着如何从你这里获取什么。  
**Dave Plummer:** Well, you don't want your operating system to be an adversary, right? And sometimes Windows can feel adversarial. Like, it doesn't have your best interests at heart, and that bugs me to a certain extent.

**Lex Fridman:** 当系统以推销为目的交互时，就像遇到过度热情的销售员，会本能产生警惕。这种微妙的情感反应，或许正是技术人性化最需要关注的细节。  
**Lex Fridman:** I mean, we have this feeling, I think we just have general distrust when somebody is super nice to you and is basically selling something. There's a certain aura about that kind of interaction. And when an operating system is interacting with you in that way, it's like…

**Dave Plummer:** 我宁愿每年付199美元用Windows专业版，就像支持一个真诚的朋友，也不愿在"免费"的表象下不断被推销和数据商业化。信任比短期利益更珍贵。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah, I would much rather pay $199 for Windows Pro per year, or 20 bucks a month, or whatever the fee schedule would be, and not be upsold any further and not have my data monetized, and those kinds of things, so…

**Lex Fridman:** 这段充满挑战的经历，是否让你对技术中的人性平衡有了更深的理解？  
Did you learn about finding the right balance from that?

**Dave Plummer:** （目光柔和）它让我学会用更温暖的视角看待技术。过去我效仿广告大师奥格威的"柠檬"广告模式——用争议性标题吸引注意，再用真诚内容赢得信任。但作为自闭症患者，我现在才真正理解：每个人对信息的感知都带着独特的情感滤镜。我原本想激发用户"贪便宜"心理的文案，在别人看来可能像是威胁。技术不仅是代码和逻辑，更是人与人心灵的桥梁。现在的我，会更用心聆听桥对面的声音。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah, I mean, I'm way more self-aware now. There are things I would do much differently, particularly in terms of the advertising. I always figured… There's a guy named David Ogilvy, and he did this ad long ago for the Volkswagen Beetle where it had a picture of a Beetle, black and white, and it just said, "Lemon," and there was a block of text below it. So it's clickbait-y and then informational, and I always tried to follow that pattern. But there are three ways to sell something, I think, and you can use sex, fear, or greed. Sex doesn't work really well for software. Fear works well for antivirus and stuff, but not so much for optimization and make your computer faster utilities. And so I always tried to cater to the greed aspect. You know, make your computer faster, get more RAM available, whatever the value proposition is. But I realize now that I'm looking at that with my knowledge, and as an autistic person, I now have an appreciation that other people are going to look at it with their background knowledge and may conclude something different. So I might be scaring people where I was just trying to incentivize or get their greed instinct going. So I'd be more sensitive about that kind of thing today.	
		
## Best Windows version		
		
**## 最佳Windows版本**

**Lex Fridman:** 问个可能有点傻的问题：如果要评选史上最佳的三款Windows操作系统，你会选哪几个版本？  
**Lex Fridman:** Ridiculous question, but what do you think are the top three Windows operating systems? The different versions?

**Dave Plummer:** 我个人偏爱Windows 2000 Server——  
**Dave Plummer:** I'm a fan of Windows 2000 server. That's

**Lex Fridman:** 真的吗？等等——  
**Lex Fridman:** Really? Okay. … Wait, wait, pl-

**Dave Plummer:** 我用它支撑自己的公司运营，还帮我兄弟的连锁美发沙龙搭建了VPN网络，配合SQL Server运行得特别稳定。  
**Dave Plummer:** That's what I ran my business on and I ran my brother's business. We set up multiple salons all VPNed to one another and using the SQL Server and…

**Lex Fridman:** 我好像没怎么接触过Windows 2000 Server。XP是什么时候发布的？  
**Lex Fridman:** I don't know if I ever got to experience Windows 2000 server, so when was XP out?

**Dave Plummer:** 2001年。  
**Dave Plummer:** 2001

**Lex Fridman:** 那之前是？  
**Lex Fridman:** What was before XP?

**Dave Plummer:** 2000版。  
**Dave Plummer:** 2000

**Lex Fridman:** 2000版很好用吗？  
**Lex Fridman:** 2000. Was that good?

**Dave Plummer:** 是的，我很喜欢。虽然它没有XP那种视觉冲击力，但作为系统——尤其是服务器系统——在当时非常出色。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah, I liked it. I mean, it doesn't have the visual flash that came with XP, but as a system, and especially as a server operating system, it was great for the day.

**Lex Fridman:** 不过从完整性、影响力和生命周期来看，XP可能是面向消费者的Windows中最伟大的版本。  
But then XP was, hmm, I would say probably from a completeness perspective and impact and how long it lasted, it was probably the greatest Windows for consumers, the operating system.

**Dave Plummer:** 我也这么认为。它的生命力确实惊人，现在还有人在使用。要不是安全更新问题，我可能还会在某些场景用XP——它能满足我98%的Windows需求。  
**Dave Plummer:** I would think so. It's certainly got the longevity for it. There are people who still run it. I mean, I'd still run it on stuff if you could get security updates 'cause it does 98% of what I need Windows to do, but…

**Lex Fridman:** 确实传奇。如果让我排，XP第一，Windows 95第二。  
**Lex Fridman:** Yeah, that was incredible. I mean, so Windows 95, I'll probably put Windows XP as the number one for me and then Windows 95 two.

**Dave Plummer:** 你的评判标准是什么？个人偏好还是行业影响力？  
**Dave Plummer:** What's your metric? Personal preference or industry impact or…

**Lex Fridman:** 行业影响力、稳定性……就像编程中有"代码气味"一样，操作系统也有种整体协调感。要看所有功能如何有机整合，设计理念是否贯穿始终且保持一致。既不能功能臃肿，又不能过度简化——  
**Lex Fridman:** Industry impact, stability, just there's certain, like, just like with programming, you have code smell. Just, like, how well all the features were orchestrated together, how there's a design philosophy that permeated the whole thing and was consistent. Not too many features, not dumbed down too much.

**Dave Plummer:** 没错。  
**Dave Plummer:** Right.

**Lex Fridman:** 既要简洁又不能功能残缺。还有蓝屏死机的频率等等因素。  
But not overcomplicated. How often it crashes to blue screen. All of those things.

**Dave Plummer:** 不知道这个比喻是否恰当——我觉得好的系统应该给人"利落"的感觉。没有太多粗糙的边缘，该有的功能响应迅速，运行干脆……  
**Dave Plummer:** I don't know if it's a very apt description, but I think of it as crisp. So there's not a lot of rough edges. It does what it does, does it snappy and…
		
## Slot machines		

**## 老虎机**

**Lex Fridman:** 你说你喜欢玩老虎机，考虑到你对硬件和软件的热爱，正好想问你：老虎机到底是怎么运作的？  
**Lex Fridman:** You said you play slot machines, and given that you love hardware and software, you're the perfect person to ask, how do slot machines work?

**Dave Plummer:** （笑）我很乐意打破你的幻想。  
**Dave Plummer:** Well, I'm happy to ruin them for you.

**Lex Fridman:** 洗耳恭听。  
**Lex Fridman:** Okay.

**Dave Plummer:** 其实我玩老虎机挺讽刺的，明明知道最终肯定会输钱。但那些闪烁的灯光和高对比度的色彩就像多巴胺盛宴，让我乐在其中。内部原理很简单：有个黑盒机制专门生成随机数，根据概率和赔付率决定结果，然后游戏再"编造"一个动画来配合这个结果——可能是三个BAR符号之类的。根本不是你想象中那种转轮停下后根据位置计算奖金，而是完全反过来的过程。  
**Dave Plummer:** So- It's ironic to me that I play slot machines because I know it's a losing bet overall, but there's a whole dopamine feast there of bright lights and high contrast colors that I enjoy. So I do play them. But what happens is, internally, there's basically a black box mechanism that does nothing more than generate the next random number and what the outcome is in terms of probability and payout. And then the game says, "I've got to make up a movie to go along with that." And maybe it's three bars or whatever it is, but there's no correlation. It's not spinning the reels, seeing where they land, and looking that up to see what you won. It's completely the other direction. It determines whether or not or if you won and then makes something up to fit that scenario.

**Lex Fridman:** 这确实彻底打破幻想了。  
**Lex Fridman:** That, that indeed is ruining it for everyone.

**Dave Plummer:** 有点扫兴是吧。  
**Dave Plummer:** A little bit.

**Lex Fridman:** 它们运行的是什么代码？  
**Lex Fridman:** What kind of code runs them?

**Dave Plummer:** 具体不太清楚。我曾想深入研究，但很难获得内部访问权限。虽然不算什么核心机密，但……它们本质上都是Windows电脑，只不过建立在某种安全 enclave 之上。  
**Dave Plummer:** I don't really know. I tried to get down and get inside access to one, and it was very hard. They don't want to tell you a lot about them, and I'm sure it's not that deep of a secret, but… They're all basic Windows PCs, but they're basic Windows PCs on top of a very secure enclave of some kind that I don't know a lot about.

**Lex Fridman:** 安全性要求肯定极高。  
**Lex Fridman:** Yeah, it has to be extremely secure, right?

**Dave Plummer:** 没错。七八十年代拉斯维加斯有个技术人员，自己烧录带后门的ROM芯片，维修时偷偷换上，半年后再回来触发后门……  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah. Well, in the 70s or 80s, there was a tech in Vegas who went around and he was burning his own ROMs for the slot machines. With a backdoor in them, so when he serviced the machine, he would just put his ROM in.

**Lex Fridman:** （笑）人类真是太有创意了。你还喜欢哪些类似的系统？  
**Lex Fridman:** Nice. I love humans so much. Anyway, do you have other favorite kinds of systems like that?

**Dave Plummer:** 我痴迷老硬件。比如修复1960年代的肌肉车、老卡车，还有古董电脑。最近半年特别沉迷PDP-11，已经组装了好几台。  
**Dave Plummer:** I like a lot of old hardware. I restore cars, so I do a lot of 1960s muscle cars, cars and trucks. And old computers, so I restore PDP-11s. It's been my fascination and my special interest for the last six months or so, and I've built a number of those.

**Lex Fridman:** 我看过你发的PDP-11/83视频。这个项目具体是？  
**Lex Fridman:** Yeah, I've seen you posting videos about it, the PDP-11/83. What's that whole project?

**Dave Plummer:** 这些年收集了不少零件，就想"组装一台终极版PDP-11"。就像现在人们组装顶配PC一样，我给它配了4MB内存——在当时可是天文数字。你看那些闪烁的指示灯，我还重写了BSD内核让这些灯能正常工作……  
**Dave Plummer:** So basically, what it is, is I had built a number of PDP-11s. And so over the years, I had acquired all these parts and I decided, "Well, let me build the best PDP-11 that I can." And so it was kind of a quest to, just like you try to max out a PC, I tried to max out a PDP-11. So it's got four megabytes of memory, which would be massive in the day. And yeah, that's it there. And it's got lots of blinking lights, and I had to rewrite the BSD kernel to make the lights work and…

**Lex Fridman:** （指着设备）这些旋钮是干嘛的？  
**Lex Fridman:** What are we looking at here? What's… So the very top is a PDP-11/70 control panel, which we can largely ignore, and then there's two chassis below that. One has- What are the different knobs? Sorry to ask dumb questions here.

**Dave Plummer:** 用来切换LED显示模式。通常能看到数据总线和地址总线，可以暂停运行，用开关编辑地址总线上的数据，直接往内存里写入内容。  
**Dave Plummer:** The knobs, they, uh- … control what view you get of the LEDs. So normally, you see the data bus and you can see the address bus. And you can pause the machine, you can edit the add- address on the bus, and you can deposit stuff into memory with the switches.

**Lex Fridman:** 这种触觉反馈加LED灯的配合，才是想象中计算机该有的样子！  
**Lex Fridman:** Man, the haptic plus the LEDs. That's what you imagine a computer to be.

**Dave Plummer:** 是啊。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah.

**Lex Fridman:** 这些DU1、DU2是什么？  
**Lex Fridman:** That's so cool. That's so cool. And then these are what? What are these? These are DU1, DU2?

**Dave Plummer:** 是种特殊的双软驱，两个磁头共用一套步进电机，像连体婴一样同步移动。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah. It's a weird floppy drive. It's a dual floppy drive with one stepper motor. So both heads seek together like Siamese twins.

**Lex Fridman:** 你修复这些设备后具体用来做什么？这些闪烁的灯都是实时的？  
**Lex Fridman:** Okay. So what, what kind of stuff are you doing with this? What are you- … are you trying to restore them? Does it actually run? Oh, all the blinking lights are real?

**Dave Plummer:** 全是实时的！为了添加新硬件支持，我不得不深入研究BSD内核。现在对内核已经很熟悉了——毕竟每加个磁盘控制器就得重新编译内核，要找到对应源码修改……  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah, it's all real. Then I had to rebuild the kernel and all that, so I had to learn the BSD kernel. I'm pretty familiar with it now to get… 'Cause you can't just add a device driver, right? You've got to rebuild the kernel to add support for whatever device. So you add a new disk controller. It's time to build the kernel, so you gotta go find the source and find the code and…


## Autism and ADHD		

**## 自闭症与ADHD**

**Lex Fridman:** 你在这台PDP-11上能运行代码吗？另外，你写过几本关于自闭症的书。作为自闭症谱系人士，我很想知道，在你看来，自闭症思维与神经典型（neurotypical）人士的思维根本差异在哪里？  
And you can run code on this? You've written a couple books on autism. Being autistic yourself, I was wondering if you could tell me about, like, fundamental differences about the mind of a person with autism versus a, let's say, a neurotypical individual.

**Dave Plummer:** 关于自闭症的核心思维理论叫做"单通道思维"（monotropism）。简单来说，我的大脑一次只做一件事，并且会非常专注地去做，做完之后才能切换到下一件事。我完全不是个能多任务处理的人，无论如何都只是个"串行单任务处理器"。自闭症通常还伴随着感官敏感和重复性行为，行为问题会让情况更复杂。当这些特质严重到个人无法调节或适应生活时，就成了一种障碍。大约有百分之一到二的人口属于这种情况。  
**Dave Plummer:** Well, the fundamental theory of thought for autism is called monotropism. And basically what that means is that my brain does one thing and does it very intensely, and then when it's done I can move on and do something else. But I'm not a multitasker. I'm a serial single-tasker by any stretch. Autism usually brings with it sensory sensitivities and repetitive behaviors, behavioral issues that compound it. And if they rise to the level where an individual can't moderate or accommodate them in their life, it becomes a disorder. And that's probably one to two percent of the population.

**Lex Fridman:** 患有自闭症的生活，最大的好处是什么？  
**Lex Fridman:** What's the biggest benefit of life with autism?

**Dave Plummer:** 我能对某个特定任务投入惊人的专注度和奉献精神。当然，这必须是我热爱的事情，是能带来回报的事情，是我能取得进展的事情，必须满足所有这些条件。就像小孩子玩火车玩具时的那种感觉，我也会有同样的感受。  
**Dave Plummer:** I can bring to bear an incredible amount of focus and dedication on a particular task. It has to be something I love, it has to be something that's rewarding, it has to be something I can make progress on, and there have to be all these things that are true about it. And it could be like a kid playing with trains. I get that same feeling.

**Lex Fridman:** 不过你也提到过你也有ADHD（注意力缺陷多动障碍）的困扰。  
**Lex Fridman:** That said, you also said that you struggle with ADHD.

**Dave Plummer:** 是的，还挺明显的。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah, a fair bit.

**Lex Fridman:** 所以这也是其中的一部分，比如维持专注方面？  
**Lex Fridman:** So that's part of the component, like, maintaining the focus?

**Dave Plummer:** 其实，_进入_专注状态才是问题所在。我很容易分心。我需要戴着降噪耳机才能入睡，或者反过来因为无法入睡而需要它，诸如此类。但一旦我进入状态，锁定了注意力，就很难再分心了。所以这有点矛盾。  
**Dave Plummer:** Actually, acquiring the focus is the issue. So I'm very easily distracted. I fall asleep with noise-canceling headphones or I can't fall asleep, that kind of thing. But once I get locked in, I'm very hard to distract. So it's kind of a paradox.

**Lex Fridman:** 哦，这很有趣。  
**Lex Fridman:** Oh, that's fascinating.

**Dave Plummer:** 很难进入那种状态。  
**Dave Plummer:** It's hard to get into that state.

**Lex Fridman:** 好的。拥有自闭症思维，最大的挑战是什么？  
**Lex Fridman:** Okay. What's the biggest challenge of life with an autistic mind?

**Dave Plummer:** 最大的挑战是，我不知道别人在想什么。所以，我只能假设如果我是你，处于你的位置，我会怎么想这次互动。这是我所能做的最好推测了。但我觉得大多数神经典型的人会有一种直觉，比如"莱克斯可能这么感觉或那么感觉，因为他行为是这样，他的反应是这样，他的面部表情是这样……"所有这些对我来说基本是无效的。所以，我和每个打交道的人，都像是在运行一个代理NPC（非玩家角色）游戏。  
**Dave Plummer:** That I don't know what anybody else is thinking. So I know what I would think about this interaction if I was in your position and I was you. And that's the best I can do. But I think most neurotypical people have a sense of, "Well, Lex probably feels this way or that way 'cause he's acting this way and his reactions are this and his facial expressions say this and…" That's all kind of lost on me. So I run a little proxy NPC game for everybody I deal with.

**Lex Fridman:** 我猜这会让社交互动变得有点复杂。  
**Lex Fridman:** So I guess that makes social interaction a little bit complicated.

**Dave Plummer:** 可能是的，没错。打电话尤其困难，因为我依赖很多其他线索，当只有声音的时候，人与人之间那些意会的部分，我大多会错过。所以我在FaceTime上会好得多，比如有人开了个玩笑，之后他们可能会笑——而在电话里，我不知道你是讽刺还是认真的，诸如此类的事情，所以……  
**Dave Plummer:** It can be, yeah. Telephone is especially hard because I rely on a lot of other cues, and when somebody is just on the phone and I just have their voice, there's so much that's implied between people that I miss. And so I'm much better on FaceTime, where if somebody makes a joke, they might smile after- Whereas on the phone, I don't know if you're being sarcastic or serious and that kind of thing, so…

**Lex Fridman:** 这么说，这些年来可能给你带来过不少麻烦吧。  
**Lex Fridman:** So that's probably gotten you into trouble over the years a bit.

**Dave Plummer:** 是的。和我妻子之间也有很多次这样的情况……嗯，自闭症会带来某种字面理解的倾向。有几年，她会说一些话，然后我会说："但这说不通啊。"她会说："你明白我的意思。"我就说："不，我知道你_说了_什么，我并不是在抬杠。我真的只理解你_说_出来的话。"我无法理解言外之意。我记得我们和别人开会时，如果会议上有三四个人，只有我是自闭症患者，我会告诉他们，他们之间在进行一种我无法参与的交流循环，我必须……你们得告诉我发生了什么，因为我真的不知道这里在交流什么。所以……  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah. There's lots of times with my wife, too, where… Well, there's a certain literalism that comes with autism. And we spent years where she would say something and I'd say, "But that doesn't make sense." She'd say, "You know what I mean." I'm like, "No, I know what you said and I'm not being just combative here. I literally only know what you said," and I don't have that. And I remember we've been in meetings with people, and you know, if there's three or four people in the meeting and I'm the only autistic person, I'll tell them that they've got this communication loop going on and I have to… You gotta tell me what's going on because I really don't know what's being said here. So…

**Lex Fridman:** 你之前告诉过我，这和早期与比尔·盖茨一次有点尴尬的会面有关。能分享一下那次互动的情况吗？自闭症在这里面起了什么作用？  
**Lex Fridman:** You told me related to this that there was an early, somewhat awkward encounter with Bill Gates. Can you share the story of that interaction and how autism comes into play here?

**Dave Plummer:** 好的。我在微软的第一个暑假，也就是我得到实习机会的那个夏天，比尔请我们所有实习生去他家。我记得那年招了大概20或者25个实习生吧，我们去他家的后院吃汉堡、喝啤酒、聊天。当然，那毕竟是比尔·盖茨，即使在那个时候他也是个大人物，所以你会有点紧张。当时我的经理本（Ben），也算是我的导师，因为他认识比尔，就带我过去介绍给他。他解释说："这是戴夫，是我们从加拿大来的实习生。在四个月的时间里，他完成了这个功能，还有复制、智能驱动（smart drive）……"他列举了我正在做的所有事情。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah. My very first summer at Microsoft when I got the internship, Bill had all the interns over. I guess it was 20 or maybe 25 of us, that got hired that year over to his house for burgers and beers and just chat in the backyard. And of course, it's still Bill Gates, and he's a big enough deal even then that you're a little nervous. And so my manager, Ben, who was sort of my mentor at the time, took me over to introduce me to Bill because he knew him. And he's explaining, "This is Dave. He's our intern from Canada. And in the space of four months, he's done this feature and just copy and smart drive," and he listed off all the stuff I was doing.

**Dave Plummer:** 但是我打断了他，因为我想："呃，实际上，是三个月。"我不得不插话，他们俩都愣了一下，"什么？"他们互相看了一眼，我意识到那可不是纠正别人的好时机。但是……  
**Dave Plummer:** But I stopped because I'm like, "Well, actually, it was three months." And I had to interrupt them, and they both kind of, "What?" And they looked at each other, and I realized that was the wrong time to… …Correct a guy. But…

**Lex Fridman:** 是的。所以你是，比如，对一些小不准确之处很在意？  
**Lex Fridman:** Yeah. So you, like, little inaccuracies?

**Dave Plummer:** 哦，简直让我发疯。  
**Dave Plummer:** Oh, drive me crazy.

**Lex Fridman:** 然后你当然不会……意识到这种纠正在随意的社交互动中可能产生的影响，对你来说并非易事。  
And then you, of course you don't… The impact that might have on a casual social interaction, it's not trivial for you to be aware of that.

**Dave Plummer:** 是的。我现在比以前好多了。以前我不知道，也不知道在对话中无意义地插入一个纠正会如何影响对方或让对方有什么感受。现在我对这方面有了更好的感知，但是……  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah. I'm much better than I used to be. Before, I didn't know and I didn't know how injecting a correction meaninglessly into a conversation could impact or make the other person feel. Now I have a better sense of it, but…

**Lex Fridman:** 对于拥有自闭症思维的人，你有什么建议可以帮助他们在这个世界上蓬勃发展？  
**Lex Fridman:** What advice would you have for folks who have an autistic mind on how to flourish in this world?

**Dave Plummer:** 在事业成功和财务方面，我能说的最重要的一点是，推销你_能做什么_，而不是推销你_自己_。因为如果你去参加求职面试，试图用你的个性和你有多棒来打动他们，效果可能好也可能不好。但如果你带着你的作品集去，说："看，这是我的GitHub记录，这些是我贡献过的很棒的项目，这是我写的实际算法，这就是我做的事情"，我认为这样会顺利得多。所以，无论你是弹钢琴还是写代码，都是如此。  
**Dave Plummer:** In terms of prosperity and finances, the biggest thing I can say is sell what you can do and not yourself. Because if you go into a job interview and you try to wow them with your personality and how amazing you are, it may or may not go well. But if you go in with your portfolio of work and say, "Look, here's my GitHub history and here are the awesome projects I contributed to, and here's the actual algorithm I wrote, and this is what I do," I think you get a lot further with that. So, whether you're playing the piano or writing code.

**Lex Fridman:** 话虽如此，大型团队中的软件工程很大部分是有社交成分的，对吧？  
**Lex Fridman:** That said, so much of software engineering on large teams has a social component to it, right?

**Dave Plummer:** 确实有，而这曾经是我的一个弱点。  
**Dave Plummer:** It does, and that was a liability for me.

**Lex Fridman:** 你是怎么……我的意思是，关于如何解决这个小难题，你学到了什么？  
**Lex Fridman:** How do you… I mean, what have you learned about how to solve that little puzzle?

**Dave Plummer:** 我觉得对我来说最大的不足是在我开始管理别人的时候，因为那时你需要关心他们的希望、梦想、抱负，什么能激励他们。他们的整个生活对我来说有点像谜，因为我假设他们希望被激励、被领导、被鼓励、获得报酬的方式都和我一模一样。但情况并非总是如此。有些人需要更多的肯定，有些人只想要钱，有些人想参加重要会议并做决策。但我对这些 largely oblivious（基本上察觉不到）。所以最终我不得不认识到，你管理的每个人都有自己的一套激励因素和优先事项，而且它们完全不同于我所以为的那样。  
**Dave Plummer:** I think the biggest deficit for me was when I started to manage people, because now you're concerned about their hopes, dreams, aspirations, what motivates them. They have entire lives that are kind of a mystery to me, because I assume they want to be motivated and led and encouraged and compensated exactly as I would. And that's not always the case. Some people need a lot more affirmation, some people just want money, some people want to be in the important meetings and make decisions. But I was largely oblivious to that. And so eventually I had to learn that everybody that you're managing has their own set of incentives and priorities, and they're completely different from what I think they probably are.

**Lex Fridman:** 所以我想，你可以让事情变得更明确，直接沟通更好，比如问问他们感兴趣的是什么。  
**Lex Fridman:** So you could, I guess, make things more explicit and just communicate better about, like, ask them about what their interests are.

**Dave Plummer:** 是的。这就是我开始做的事情，直接询问。因为让我去委婉地引导别人很困难，我不擅长那种社交舞蹈，所以……  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah. And that's something I started doing, is overtly asking. Because it's hard for me to nudge somebody there. I'm not good with that kind of social dance, so…

**Lex Fridman:** 是的，社交舞蹈的一部分在于有很多未尽之言。你可以某种程度上揣摩出来……你可以读懂人。但如果……对于自闭症来说，这可能有点困难，所以你必须让事情变得更明确。另外，比如讽刺、反讽和幽默可能也比较困难。我真想亲眼看看你早期在微软的一些互动经历。我是说，一些最伟大的工程师就有这样的思维，所以……  
**Lex Fridman:** Yeah, part of the social dance is there's a lot of stuff that's unsaid. You can kind of figure out… You can read people. But if that's… With autism, it might be a little bit difficult to do that, and so you have to make things more explicit. Plus, like, sarcasm and satire and humor might be difficult. I would love to be a fly on the wall in some of your earlier interactions with Microsoft. I mean, some of the greatest engineers have a mind like this, so…

**Dave Plummer:** 是啊，有人朝我扔过笔记本电脑之类的，我敢说那是我自己的错，所以……  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah, I've had laptops thrown at me and stuff, and I'm sure it was my own fault, so…

**Lex Fridman:** 你写过关于"10秒自闭症测试"的内容。能解释一下这是怎么运作的吗？  
**Lex Fridman:** You write about the 10-second autism test. Could you explain how this works?

**Dave Plummer:** 好的。当然，任何只有两个答案的测试错误率都很高，但是……问题是：对于整个社会来说，来自人民的，是合作更重要还是创造力更重要？如果你必须选一个，哪个最重要？大多数神经典型的人通常会倾向于选择合作，而谱系中的人则更倾向于创造力，因为他们是独立的问题解决者。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah. Now, there is, of course… Anything that has two answers has a high error rate, but… So what's more important to society as a whole from the people, is it cooperation or creativity? And if you had to pick one, which is the most important? And most neurotypical people will generally lean towards cooperation, whereas people on the spectrum tend to lean towards creativity as individual problem-solvers.

**Lex Fridman:** 当然，这存在一定的错误率。  
**Lex Fridman:** Of course, there's some kind of error rate there.

**Dave Plummer:** 所以如果你想将准确度提高一倍，你可以用第二个测试：你问，"一个房间里有10把椅子，进来6个人坐下。还剩下几把椅子？"有些人会说4把，但我会说10把，因为房间里确实还有10把椅子。字面上是真的。我并不是在故意找茬。  
**Dave Plummer:** So if you want to double your precision, you can use a second test, which is you ask, "There's a room with 10 chairs, and six people come in and sit down in those chairs. How many chairs are left?" Now, some people are going to say four, but I'm going to say 10, because that's how many chairs are still there. Literally true. And I'm not being a dick.

**Lex Fridman:** 嗯，好的。  
**Lex Fridman:** Yeah, okay.

**Dave Plummer:** 我不是想把事情复杂化，但我的思维就是这样运作的。所以当我看到那个问题时，答案取决于你如何理解它。  
**Dave Plummer:** I'm not trying to be complicated, but that is how my mind works. And so when I see that question, it's like it depends how you answer it.

**Lex Fridman:** 所以这是关于你理解事物的字面程度？  
**Lex Fridman:** So you're how literally you take things?

**Dave Plummer:** 是的。所有事物对我来说都非常字面化。我记得小时候，我外公在厨房里为我妈妈做一个花盆架。他用了些我觉得有点过分的大角铁支架，我说："你觉得这够结实能撑住花盆吗？"他说："这都够结实能撑住一匹马了。"我当时只有五岁，但我非常困惑：第一，你为什么要把马牵进厨房？第二，你为什么要把马放在花盆架上？所有这些事情对我来说都毫无意义，尽管这显然是个比喻。但在我的大部分生活中，我把比喻当作字面意思来理解，所以……  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah. Everything is very literal for me. I remember as a kid, my grandfather was building a planter holder in the kitchen for my mom. And he was using these big angle brackets that I thought were a little overkill, and I said, "Do you think that'll be big enough to hold the plant?" And he says, "It'll be big enough to hold a horse." And I was only five, but I was very confused about, A, why you would bring a horse into your kitchen, why you would put a horse up on a planter, and all of these things that didn't make any sense to me when obviously it was a figure of speech. But for a lot of my life, I took figures of speech as literal, so…

**Lex Fridman:** 你提到过"情感后处理"作为一种策略，用来替代社交互动，以便你可以逆向工程来帮助你理解神经典型的世界。我觉得这对很多人会有用。这具体包括什么？它是如何帮助你的？  
**Lex Fridman:** You've mentioned emotional post-processing as a strategy you use to replace social interactions so you can sort of reverse engineer to help you understand the neurotypical world. I think this is going to be useful to a lot of people. What does that entail? How does that help you?

**Dave Plummer:** 所以，如果我遇到某人，特别是新认识的人，比如即使是今天第一次见到你，之后回家我会回放所有我需要做出选择的时刻。可能会先回想最让我不舒服的那些时刻，找出在那个时刻我做错了什么？我漏掉了什么？对方当时在想什么？下次如何改进那种情况？在极端糟糕的情况下，我是否需要去补救或打个电话之类的。但是……在我人生中确实发生过几次。比如，我修复了一辆我父亲在69年买的新车。我现在还留着它，所以这车我们已经拥有50年了。  
**Dave Plummer:** So if I meet somebody, particularly somebody new, and it's my first couple interactions with them, so even meeting you today, then I will go home later and replay all of the moments where I had choices to make. And probably the most uncomfortable ones first, to find out, what did I do wrong in that moment? What did I miss? What was the other person thinking? How can I improve that kind of situation next time, and do I need to go fix it or make a phone call, that kind of thing in a bad… you know, in an extreme case. But… And that's happened a couple times in my life. Like, I had a car restored that my dad had bought new in '69. I still have it, so we've had it 50 years.

**Dave Plummer:** 大约20年前，我把它送去修复了，这个过程花了三年，工匠们在这辆车上工作了数千个小时。我去取车时，仔细检查了车子，对工作成果印象非常深刻，我说着"哦，这里很好，那里很棒"等等。然后我飞回家，寄出支票，车子也被运回来了。然后大概过了十年我才意识到，有一群工匠为我的车工作了三年，我大概应该好好夸赞他们一番，说他们干得有多棒，但我从来没那样做过，因为那不是我当时想要或需要的。我完全没有意识到这一点。  
**Dave Plummer:** About 20 years ago, I had it restored, and it was a three-year process of craftsmen working on this car for thousands of hours. I go out to pick it up and I'm inspecting the car and I'm very impressed with the work, and I'm saying, "Oh, this is nice and this is great," and everything else. Then I fly home and write the check and the car gets delivered. And then I realized probably 10 years later that I had a whole bunch of craftsmen that had worked on my car for three years, and I probably should have blown some smoke up their butts about what a great job they did, but I never did that because it's not what I wanted or needed in that moment. And I was completely oblivious to that.

**Dave Plummer:** 所以我给那家店的经理，或者说老板，发了封邮件，我说："不知道你还记不记得，但10年前我来取车的时候，我可能看起来不太满意，但我想让你知道，我对所有的一切，对质量等等都非常满意。"他回信了。他说："我经常想起那个时刻。"（笑）所以我就想，"现在我很高兴我提了这件事。"  
**Dave Plummer:** So I sent an email to the manager, or to the owner of the place, and I said, "I don't know if you remember this, but 10 years ago, I picked up my car and I probably looked unimpressed, but I want you to know that I was very impressed with everything and the quality and everything else." And he wrote back. He's like, "I've thought of that moment often." (laughs) So I'm like, "Now I'm glad I brought it up."

**Lex Fridman:** 是的，人际互动中有一些细微之处对人们来说意义重大，如果你直接问他们，他们可能无法明确表达，但这确实很重要。当这些地方出了问题，当有什么不对劲时，会让他们很困扰。  
**Lex Fridman:** Yeah, there's subtle things about human interaction that mean a lot to people, and if you ask them straight up, they might not be able to articulate that, but it means a lot. And when it's off, when something is off, it bothers them.

**Dave Plummer:** 对。  
**Dave Plummer:** Right.

**Lex Fridman:** 但是要逆向工程这个，对于一个可能感知不到人类互动中那些细微差别的人来说，是很困难的。  
But to reverse engineer that, to figure that out for a person who might not sense those little subtleties of human interaction is tough.

**Dave Plummer:** 这也是一个切入共情话题的好地方。因为社区里有一种看法，认为自闭症患者缺乏共情能力，但我认为根本不是这样。我只能代表我自己说话。我觉得自己相当有共情能力，但我认为问题出在沟通上，而且是双向的。因为我不知道你的感受，所以很难对此产生共情，除非你告诉我你正在经历什么。一旦我知道了，一旦我理解了你的想法，我可能会非常为你感到难过。但在那之前，我会假设你会像我处在你的位置时那样处理问题——以我目前所知的方式。  
**Dave Plummer:** That's a good point to jump in there, too, on empathy because there is some perception in the community that people with autism lack empathy, and I don't think that's the case at all. I can only speak for myself. I feel fairly empathetic, but I think the problem is a communication one, and it works in both directions, whereas I don't know how you're feeling, so it's hard for me to be empathetic with it until you communicate to me what it is you're experiencing. And then once I know, once I have an understanding of what's going on in your head, I can feel incredibly sorry for you. But until then, I'm going to assume you're going to handle it just like I would in your position, in my case, with what I know now.

**Lex Fridman:** 你对"另一边"的人有什么建议？他们怎样才能帮助你成为更好的朋友、伴侣或同事？他们应该如何与你沟通，以便提供更多信息来帮助你？  
**Lex Fridman:** What advice would you give to people on the other side? How can they help you be a better friend or partner or colleague? How should they communicate with you to help, like, give more information?

**Dave Plummer:** 好的。要非常具体。不要假设我能捕捉到线索、细微差别和微妙之处。所以，如果你想引导我做出某种特定行为，最好直接说："戴夫，你需要这样做。"  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah. Be really specific. And don't assume I'm going to pick up on clues and nuance and subtlety. So if you're trying to nudge me into a particular behavior, you're much better off saying, "Dave, this is what you need to do."

**Lex Fridman:** 我今天有什么地方做得不够好吗？  
**Lex Fridman:** Have I failed in any way today?

**Dave Plummer:** 没有，目前还没有。  
**Dave Plummer:** No, not yet.

**Lex Fridman:** 好的。如果1到10分，你给我打几分？6分？7分？  
All right. What score would you give me out of one to ten? Am I a six? A seven?

**Dave Plummer:** 7.5分。  
**Dave Plummer:** 7.5.

**Lex Fridman:** 沟通方面？7.5分？（笑）浮点数。不错。"伪装"（Masking）。你得告诉我那是什么。对许多谱系人士来说，这是一种重要的体验。什么是"伪装"？跟我讲讲你经历过的任何与"伪装"相关的事情。  
Communication? 7.5? (laughs) Floating point. Nice. Masking. You got to tell me what that is. It's a significant experience for many on the spectrum. What is masking? And tell me about any of the experiences you've had with masking.

**Dave Plummer:** "伪装"是，可能这个描述不太准确，但它指的是"表现得正常"的行为。也就是说，我如何在社交场合中约束自己，以一种其他神经典型人士能够以正确方式接受和认可的方式行事？你在社交互动中所做的一切，从挥手、做面部表情、语调到姿势，都是一个巨大的刻意为之的行为，而且是项工作。对大多数人来说，这是自然而然的，就是他们的行为方式，而且酷的人做得非常好。但对谱系人士来说，你必须伪装这一切。  
**Dave Plummer:** So masking is, and it's probably not the right way to describe it, but it's the act of acting normal. And that is, how do I conduct myself in a social situation in a way that other neurotypical people are going to receive and accept it the right way? And everything you do in a social interaction, from waving my hands to making facial expressions to tone of voice to posture, it's a huge contrivance and it's work. So it comes natural to most people, it's just what they do, and cool people do it really well. But for somebody on the spectrum, you've got to fake it all.

**Lex Fridman:** 是的。表现得正常。  
**Lex Fridman:** Yeah. Acting normal.

**Dave Plummer:** 有一首Rush乐队的歌，你知道这个乐队吗？《Limelight》。是尼尔·皮尔特（Neil Peart）写的。我只能推测已经去世的人，所以我感觉他可能也在谱系上。歌词大概是这样的："整个世界确实是个舞台，我们只是演员，表演者和扮演者，彼此互为观众。"（"All the world's indeed a stage, and we are merely players, performers and portrayers, each another's audience."）他在歌里详细谈到无法把陌生人当朋友对待，能够伪装出一种情感（affect）等等，所以看起来他在歌里对"伪装"挣扎了很多。我并不知道实情，但那是我从歌里感受到的。  
**Dave Plummer:** There's a song by Rush, you know the band? Limelight. And it's written by Neil Peart. I only speculate about people who have passed on, so I've got a sense he was probably on the spectrum. But the line is something like, "All the world's indeed a stage, and we are merely players, performers and portrayers, each another's audience." And he talks at length in the song about not being able to treat strangers as friends and being able to fake an affect and all that, so it seems like he's struggling with masking a lot in the song. I have no idea, but that was what I took from it.

**Lex Fridman:** 你曾将"崩溃"（meltdowns）描述为一种 overwhelming（难以承受的）经历。能描述一下"崩溃"吗？通常是什么引发了崩溃？  
**Lex Fridman:** You described meltdowns as an overwhelming experience. Can you describe meltdowns? What typically triggers a meltdown?

**Dave Plummer:** 通常，这是指……当你情绪上 overwhelmed（不堪重负）到无法再管理自己行为的地步。就像电影《雨人》里，他试图上飞机时被强迫，然后开始失控。那就是一次崩溃。或者我在……他们拍了一个……嗯，实际上，可能我在媒体上看到的最好描绘是……有一部电视剧，里面有个医生是自闭症患者？他是……反正有一部电视剧，里面有个自闭症的外科医生，他最终因为自闭症被禁止做手术，而他一直想成为一名外科医生，于是他彻底崩溃了，那是电视上相当好的描绘。  
**Dave Plummer:** Generally, it is… it's when you're emotionally overwhelmed to the point that you can't manage your behavior anymore. So you see it in the movie Rain Man when he's trying to get on the airplane and he's kind of forced and he starts losing it. That's a meltdown. Or I've seen it on… They did kind of a… Well, actually, probably the best portrayal I've seen in media is… What's the TV show where the doctor is autistic? He's… Anyway, there's a TV show where a doctor's autistic and he's a surgeon and he is eventually banned from surgery because of his autism, and he's always wanted to be a surgeon and he has a complete meltdown, and it's a pretty good portrayal on television.

**Lex Fridman:** 实际上发生了什么？就像，你跨过了一个阈值，然后就……  
**Lex Fridman:** What is actually happening? Like, there's a threshold you cross that it's just like…

**Dave Plummer:** 是的。开关跳闸了。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah. The switch flips.

**Lex Fridman:** 就像是大脑算法的蓝屏死机——  
**Lex Fridman:** It's like a blue screen essentially-

**Dave Plummer:** 是的。差不多。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah. Kind of.

**Lex Fridman:** ——对于大脑算法来说？  
**Lex Fridman:** … for the brain algorithm?

**Dave Plummer:** 所以开关跳闸了。你进入了一种原始脑状态。我认为你的前额叶皮层在某种程度上关闭了，所以你失去了决策和过滤的能力。在那种状态下，你是一个非常爬虫类脑的状态。这真的是一种恐慌状态。所以，这是一种恐慌和战斗或逃跑反应，是对无法容忍当前现实的反应。也许是因为事情太令人沮丧，或者你被太多随机事件干扰，或者你经历了糟糕的旅行日，或者工作中的争吵，等等，这些累积到一定程度，现在有某个东西触发你了，你的大脑就失去了充分调节你行为的能力。  
**Dave Plummer:** So the switch flips. You go to a primitive brain. Your frontal cortex shuts down to an extent, I think, so you don't have the benefit of decision-making and filtering. You're a very reptilian brain in that state. And it's really a panic state. And so it's a panic and a fight or flight response to not being able to tolerate the current reality. And perhaps it's been so frustrating or you've been so randomized or you had a bad travel day or an argument at work or whatever, it's added up to the point that something has now triggered you and your brain loses its ability to adequately moderate your behavior.

**Lex Fridman:** 那爱情和人际关系呢？这方面有哪些挑战？你知道，有个节目叫《自闭也有爱》（Love on the Spectrum）。  
**Lex Fridman:** What about love and relationships? What are some of the challenges of that and… You know, there's a show, Love on the Spectrum.

**Dave Plummer:** 我听说过。我没看过，但我听说过。  
**Dave Plummer:** I've heard of it. I've not seen it, but I've heard of it.

**Lex Fridman:** 因为某些方面，比如对事物的字面理解，只会让浪漫关系的复杂性在这种情境下更加显化。  
Because certain aspects, like literal interpretation of things, it just makes the complexity of romantic relationships even more explicit in that context.

**Dave Plummer:** 你知道，我结婚31年了，在一起37年，所以有很长的历史了。我觉得我们第一次意识到我们非常不同，是有天晚上我们坐在房子前的车里，天黑了，街对面有一栋漂亮的房子，房子有一些用锚链连接起来的大砖柱，围成了院子的栅栏。我看着这些东西，因为它们大约两英尺见方，还有顶石，我就在想，"你知道，我在想它们是空心的还是回填了土？"是填了混凝土还是什么？"我现在的妻子看着我说，"你怎么了？""你脑子里怎么会有关心这个的地方？"  
**Dave Plummer:** You know, I've been married 31 years and together for 37, so a long history there, and I think our first indication that we knew we were very different was we were sitting in the car one night out front of the house at dark and across the street there's kind of a nice house, and it has these big brick pillars that are linked by, like, anchor chains and it forms a fence around the yard. And I'm looking at these things 'cause they're about two feet square and they got capstone and I'm like, "You know, I wonder if they're hollow or are they backfilled?" Are they filled with concrete or what?" And my now wife looks at me and she's like, "What's wrong with you?" "Why do you have a place in your head that cares about that?"

**Lex Fridman:** 是啊。这很棒。  
**Lex Fridman:** Yeah. That's great.

**Dave Plummer:** 我们在那一刻就知道，我是在充满激情地投入和关心，她也在充满激情地投入，但（她的疑问是）你为什么会甚至担心那种事情？我们知道我们非常不同。  
**Dave Plummer:** And we just knew in the moment that I was passionately involved and caring, and she was passionately involved, and why would you even worry about that kind of thing? We knew we were very different.

**Lex Fridman:** 是的。非常具体，看似无关紧要的细节。  
**Lex Fridman:** Yeah. Very specific, seemingly irrelevant details.

**Dave Plummer:** 但是……我从来就不太擅长和人打交道。我猜，当别人喜欢我的时候，我总是后知后觉。我儿子也是这样，毕竟“苹果落地离树不远”。我给他买了件T恤，上面写着：“如果你在撩我，请明确告诉我，因为我完全察觉不到。”我自己也差不多。我的意思是，我必须花很长时间待在人们身边，慢慢让大家接受我，因为我没有任何“套路”，我完全不懂那种场合需要的社交舞步。所以我唯一的选择就是做我自己，而这对一些人来说还挺管用的。  
**Dave Plummer:** But- …I was never good with people. I don’t get it when people like me, I guess. And so my son is the same way, because they don’t fall very far from the tree. I got them a T-shirt that says, “If you’re hitting on me, please let me know and be specific, because I’m clueless.” And it’s very similar for me. I mean, I had to be around a long time and kind of grow on people because I had no game, I had no ability to do the social dances that that whole thing requires. So my only option is to just be myself, and that works for some people.

**Lex Fridman:** 那像说“我爱你”这样的话，你能自然表达吗？  
**Lex Fridman:** Were you able to say, like, “I love you,” that kind of stuff?

**Dave Plummer:** 能啊。我是说，她家里那种表达情感的氛围比我家开放多了。所以这对我来说也是个成长过程。不过，是的，这方面我倒没什么问题。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah. I mean, her family was way more open with that kind of thing than mine was. So it was a growing period for me. But, yeah, that’s not a problem I have.

**Lex Fridman:** 好的。不过，这似乎并不重要。说这些话到底能起到什么实际作用呢？  
**Lex Fridman:** Okay. All right. But it seems unimportant. Like, what is that actually accomplishing?

**Dave Plummer:** 嗯，现在我们经常会互相确认和检查状态。最近几年，我们形成了一个习惯，她会突然问：“你还好吗？”我就回：“还好。”这里有两层意思：一个是她问“你还好吗？”，另一个是我的回应方式。因为如果我只是简单回个“还好”，她就知道肯定有事。  
**Dave Plummer:** Well, now we do a lot of affirmation and checking. In the last couple of years, we do a thing where she’ll just be like, “You good?” I’m like, “Yeah.” And there’s two steps to that. There’s the “Are you good?” and then there’s my response, because if I’m like, “Yeah,” she knows something’s up.

**Lex Fridman:** 是啊。所以，  
**Lex Fridman:** Yeah. So,

**Dave Plummer:** 所以我们之间总是有这种一来一往的“信号检查”，因为我们无法仅仅通过观察对方就知道发生了什么，所以我们就建立了这种明确的确认机制。  
**Dave Plummer:** And so there’s always this pinging back and forth because there’s not the ability to read people just from looking at them to know what’s going on, so we have this explicit check mechanism, I think, where we develop that.

**Lex Fridman:** 所以，“还好”和“不好”之间有着天壤之别。这再次体现了人类沟通的微妙之处。你曾写过人们有时会感觉自己“有点自闭”的这种体验。能详细阐述一下这个概念吗？  
**Lex Fridman:** So there’s a vast chasm between yeah and neh. Again, that subtlety of human communication. You’ve written about the experience that people have of feeling, quote, “a little bit autistic.” Could you elaborate on this concept?

**Dave Plummer:** 好的。我认为很多人，可能占总人口的10%到20%，在某种程度上处于自闭谱系上，但其程度尚未严重到构成障碍。不过他们仍然拥有许多源于自闭症的特征。我认为，如果他们能够理解、识别并以最佳方式管理这些行为，他们就可以既利用这些特质带来的某些技能优势，又能调解随之而来的一些缺陷和问题。我写这个主要是为了我的孩子们，因为据我所知，他们都没有自闭症谱系障碍，但他们都有一些我的、尤其与此相关的行为特点，所以我觉得不如给他们写一本小小的“使用手册”。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah, I think a lot of people, maybe 10 to 20% of the population, is somewhere on the autism spectrum, but isn’t impacted by it enough that it rises to the level of a disorder. But they still have many of the characteristics that arise from autism. And I think if they can understand and identify and manage some of those behaviors in an optimal way, they can both leverage them and take advantage of some of the skills and mediate some of the deficits and problems that come with it. And I wrote it mostly for my kids because none of them, as far as I know, have ASD, but they’ve all got certain aspects of my behavior that are particularly related to it, so I thought I’d write a little manual for them, basically.

**Lex Fridman:** 嗯。为什么你觉得有那么多程序员，那些优秀、伟大的程序员和工程师，都在这个谱系上呢？  
**Lex Fridman:** Hmm. Why do you think so many programmers, like excellent, great programmers and great engineers, are on the spectrum?

**Dave Plummer:** 我认为是那种心无旁骛的专注力、化繁为简的能力，以及对于“东西里面到底是什么”的终极好奇心。这是我一生的执念：里面有什么？我得把我妈的烤箱拆开，因为我想知道那个翻页钟是怎么工作的。我觉得如果你想成为一名程序员，这是个好习惯。  
**Dave Plummer:** I think it’s that single-minded focus and the ability to reduce a problem, and to be ultimately curious about what’s inside stuff. That’s been an obsession for me my whole life: what’s inside? I gotta take my mom’s oven apart because I gotta know how the flip clock works. And I think that’s a good habit to have if you’re gonna be a programmer.

**Lex Fridman:** 还有那种愿意、甚至是兴奋地去钻研细节的劲头。是啊。你今年希望编程打造什么酷东西？你在忙什么？我们刚才提到用强化学习玩《Tempest》的项目。顺便问一下，那个项目进展如何了？比如，预计什么时候能成功并实现“通关”？  
And being willing, being excited to get into the details. Yeah. What’s a cool thing you hope to program to build this year? What are you working on? So we got the RL learning how to play Tempest. Where are you on that, by the way? Like, what’s the ETA on success and dominance? Like victory?

**Dave Plummer:** 嗯，已经接近成功了。我觉得现在主要是调整模型大小、层数之类的参数，让它能突破某个瓶颈。不过，你知道，这大概是几千行Lua代码加几千行Python代码，它们都能交互并正常工作，所以现在95%的工作已经完成了。剩下的就是调参和期待好结果了。  
**Dave Plummer:** Well, it’s very close to working. I think now it’s tweaking the model size and layers and stuff like that to get it to learn past the one threshold. But, you know, it’s a couple thousand lines of Lua and it’s a couple thousand lines of Python, and they all interact and they all work, so it’s like 95% of the work is done now. It’s tuning hyperparameters and hoping for the best.

**Lex Fridman:** 所以从某种意义上说，它已经成功了，现在是想看看它能达到什么高度？  
**Lex Fridman:** So it’s already a success in a sense, but now you’re seeing how far can this go?

**Dave Plummer:** 是的，我的目标是它能打败我。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah, my goal was to be able to beat me.

**Lex Fridman:** 这可不容易。  
**Lex Fridman:** That’s tough for.

**Dave Plummer:** 是不容易，不过现在很多游戏AI都比人类玩得好了，但可能没有这么复杂的游戏。  
**Dave Plummer:** It is, but lots of games now are, you know, they play them better than humans, but maybe not games this complex.

**Lex Fridman:** 你还在做其他什么酷项目？今年还希望构建什么？  
**Lex Fridman:** What other cool things are you working on? What do you hope to build this year?

**Dave Plummer:** PDP-11相关的项目，我正在想办法搞到一个叫RA82的驱动器。那是个14英寸的大家伙，转速3600 RPM，声音听起来像洗衣机。然后我得找到对应的控制卡，写代码，把它集成到驱动里，让整套系统跑起来。  
**Dave Plummer:** The PDP-11 stuff, I’m trying to get what’s called an RA82 drive. It’s the big 14-inch monster that spins at 3600 rpm and sounds like a washing machine. And then I’ll find the controller card and write the code and integrate it into the driver and try to get that all working.

**Lex Fridman:** 你打算在上面运行什么样的代码？  
**Lex Fridman:** What kind of code are you trying to run on it?

**Dave Plummer:** 我得让整个驱动程序栈工作起来，所以我必须把它的驱动程序集成到内核里。  
**Dave Plummer:** I’m going to have to get the driver stack to work, so I have to incorporate the driver for it into the kernel.
		
## Fastest programming language		

**## 最快的编程语言**

**Lex Fridman:** 你最近装了台1TB内存的机器？这配置太夸张了，是有什么特别的任务吗？  
**Lex Fridman:** You built a machine recently with one terabyte of RAM. How did that happen and why?

**Dave Plummer:** 是为了我们的"GitHub Primes"项目。你搜一下就能看到，这个项目用将近100种编程语言实现了同一套质数算法。  
**Dave Plummer:** We have a project called GitHub Primes. If you just search for GitHub Primes, you'll find it, and it is…

**Lex Fridman:** GitHub Primes？这名字有意思。  
**Lex Fridman:** GitHub Primes.

**Dave Plummer:** 我们设定了统一的公平规则，让参与者用各自最拿手的语言实现算法。每天晚上自动跑分，最后统计出哪种语言速度最快。  
**Dave Plummer:** …a single set of prime number algorithms implemented in about 100 different languages. So it's the exact same algorithm, and we require that you follow certain rules to make it fair. Then you express that algorithm in whatever language you choose to the best of your ability, and we run a benchmark every night, and we compile the results and find out which languages are fastest.

**Lex Fridman:** （盯着屏幕）就是这个界面？你用这台怪兽机器跑测试？这项目太疯狂了——相当于编程语言界的奥林匹克啊！  
**Lex Fridman:** Is this the one? Oh, so this is it. You're using this for? Oh, so- This machine runs those tests? Okay, you've got to tell me about this project. This is an epic project. So you're comparing the performance of the different programming languages.

**Dave Plummer:** 所有代码都打包成独立的Docker容器同时开跑。现在暂时是Zig语言领先——不过战况很激烈，C++优化一波就能反超，然后Zig那边又不服气地追上来。  
**Dave Plummer:** Of all these languages. So they all get built into an individual Docker container, and then they all run. And so- It does, it varies. People will make an improvement to the C++ then it'll pass for a while, and then the Zig guys will get angry and come back and make it faster.

**Lex Fridman:** 具体比的是什么算法？怎么衡量性能差距？  
**Lex Fridman:** So what have you learned about which languages? Which language usually wins? So Zig, Rust, C++, C? And what kind of code is being run? What's the piece of code that they're trying to run to measure the performance?

**Dave Plummer:** 规则是在5秒内循环计算1亿以内的质数，必须用筛法，每个数最多占1比特内存。像老古董6502处理器因为只有64K内存，就只能当表演项目参展了。  
**Dave Plummer:** So what they're doing is they're solving the primes up to 100 million as many times per second as they can in a five-second loop. No. So you can do anything you want, but it has to be a prime sieve. You're allowed to use one bit per integer at most, so you can't use a byte, which is cheaper and easier. There are a number of rules like that that you have to allocate the memory within your timed loop. And so we have a set of rules and we have some solutions that don't follow the rules like the 6502 because you've only got 64K, you can't do 100 million sieve.

**Lex Fridman:** （翻看数据）Zig第一，后面是Rust、Nim、Haskell……C语言居然比Zig慢一半？连PowerShell都来参赛了？  
**Lex Fridman:** I'm looking at a snapshot here from a couple years ago, Zig was at the top, then Rust, then Nim, Haskell. Oh, no, this is not, this is not ordered by slowness, or is it? It is. So C would be 1.5 times as long as Zig. Wow. Okay. Fascinating. Well, it's a super cool project. And we've got in crazy languages like PowerShell. There's a version in PowerShell, and stuff like that.

**Dave Plummer:** 现在由欧洲的Rucker和Tudor负责维护。最早只有Python、C#和C++三个版本，我视频一发出去，各种语言版本就像野火一样冒出来，只好找专人管理了。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah, there's two guys over in Europe Rucker and Tudor basically own this now. I started as just three languages, I did Python, C#, and C++. And I checked them in and I published the episode, and then people started throwing more solutions in there and it just got out of hand, so I had to get somebody to manage that one and they've been great doing that for me.

**Lex Fridman:** 你写代码时最有成就感的瞬间是什么？  
**Lex Fridman:** What's the happiest moment for you when you're programming and building a thing? Like, what do you enjoy most?

**Dave Plummer:** 当复杂的设计第一次运行就严丝合缝地按设想工作，那种满足感就像中了彩票——不过真遇到这种情况我反而会怀疑，是不是哪里埋了坑没发现。  
**Dave Plummer:** I think the most fun for me is when I build something complex, and I've thought through how it should work, and then I run it and it does work that way. That creates intense satisfaction. So seeing the results come out the way that I planned them and have it work, because it rarely does the first time, but… I never trust that. I always feel like I'm missing something.

## Future of programming		

**## 编程的未来**

**Lex Fridman:** 确实如此。不过你知道，用C++这类编译型语言时，写完代码一次性编译通过，没有警告也没有错误，那种感觉特别爽。你觉得编程的未来会怎样？不知道你接触过LLM代码生成没有，用过Cursor或者带代码生成的VSCode吗？  
**Lex Fridman:** That's true. But, you know, with compiled languages like C++, that's always a good feeling. You write a bunch of code, and you compile it all, it compiles without warnings, without errors. It's a cool feeling. What do you think is the future of programming? So now, I don't know how you've got to really experience the impact of LLMs with code generation. Have you used Cursor much, Cursor VSCode with code generation?

**Dave Plummer:** 我在Python项目里大量使用，因为Python不算我的强项。它生成的代码就像实时教学，让我学到很多新技巧。如果完全手写Python，我的代码量估计是AI生成的四倍——熟练的人写Python确实非常简洁。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah, I've done a ton of it for the Python side because I'm not great with Python, and I'm kind of new to it. So I found it very helpful because I've learned a lot from watching the code that it generates if I don't know how to do something. Because if I were to write Python from scratch, it's going to be about four times as long as what the AI can crank out because Python can be pretty terse if you're good at it.

**Lex Fridman:** 所以你算是为这个项目现学的Python？这倒是个很好的案例：一个C++高手如何快速掌握新语言。  
**Lex Fridman:** Oh, that's cool. So you essentially learned Python for this project? So this is a good case study of a great programmer in C++ quickly learning a language.

**Dave Plummer:** 对，我管这叫"感觉流编程"——跟着直觉走。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah. Yeah, I'm vibe coding my way through it, I guess.

**Lex Fridman:** "感觉流编程"这说法真妙。对于已经懂编程的人，用AI生成代码来学习新语言或新思路确实高效，因为你完全能看懂它生成的Python代码。  
**Lex Fridman:** Vibe coding your way through it. I mean, that is a really powerful use case to learn a language for. If you're already a good programmer, to learn either a new language or a new way to approach a problem by having it generate it because you already you probably understand the Python code it generates.

**Dave Plummer:** 没错。看到代码都能理解，但从零创造是另一回事。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah. Yeah, it's all pretty self-explanatory once you see it but, you know, creating it from whole cloth is a little different, so.

**Lex Fridman:** 但前提是你得先会编程才能这样使用它。  
**Lex Fridman:** Yeah, but you still have to learn how to program in order to use it in that way.

**Dave Plummer:** 还要能读懂代码，知道下一步该让它做什么。纯新手很难玩转"感觉流"，但AI能让熟练的程序员如虎添翼。  
**Dave Plummer:** Oh, and to read it and to know what to tell it to do next and all that, yeah. I don't think you can vibe code yourself if you're just new and haven't coded but if you're a good programmer, AI can make you incredibly powerful.

**Lex Fridman:** 你觉得5年、10年、20年后编程会变成什么样？现在"感觉流编程"还带点玩笑性质，因为完全不懂编程的人靠它做出来的系统根本没法用。而像你这样的高手，更多是把AI当作智能自动补全——用来学习新API、新语言，或者快速实现特定功能。但随着AI越来越聪明，编程的本质可能会彻底改变。你会考虑这个问题吗？  
**Lex Fridman:** What do you think is the future of programming, like 5, 10, 20 years from now, this whole process? Now, vibe coding is kind of a fun meme thing because you still have to be… The people that don't know how to program and are just vibe coding are almost entirely creating systems that are not usable in production. They're not… It's very difficult- It's very difficult to create a product. And the people who are already great programmers kind of vibe code just for… in the way that you're doing it. They're basically… it's just a fancy autocomplete, and they end up editing it, or it's a way to learn a new API, or new language, or a new whatever, a new specific use case, or maybe a different kind of gooey component or something like that. But as they get smarter and smarter, we don't know where the ceiling is. That might change the nature of what it means to be a programmer. So do you think about that?

**Dave Plummer:** 我觉得未来会更像"提示词工程"。就像桥梁建筑师过去要亲自焊接钢梁，现在是在CAD软件里拖拽预制构件。编程也会变成这样：不再逐行写代码，而是描述组件间的交互逻辑，让AI生成具体实现。不过距离"给我写个兼容Linux的内核"这种程度还早。  
**Dave Plummer:** I do. I don't want to say prompt engineer, but I think it's going to be something like that in the sense that if you're an architect building a bridge, at some point, guys were down there welding beams together, but now you're dragging things around in AutoCAD and assembling from big pre-formed sections. And I assume that's what programming will be like. You won't be in there throwing individual lines of code around; you'll be moving components and interfaces and describing to the AI what those interactions should be and letting it build the components. But I think we're still quite a ways from it being able to whole cloth generate… You can't say, "Give me a Linux kernel that's compatible with Linux." One day, we'll be able to, and it'll crank it out, but we're not there yet.

**Lex Fridman:** 抽象层提升得这么快，会让人失落吗？你从机器码、汇编一路走到C/C++，现在居然要用自然语言"感觉流编程"了。  
Does it make you sad that we're climbing the layers of abstraction so quickly so you, somebody that used to do machine code and then assembly, then C and C++, that we're getting to a point where we're vibe coding with natural language?

**Dave Plummer:** 其实我很庆幸生在这个时代。40年间我从TTL逻辑电路一路玩到AI编程，中间每个环节都亲手摸过。现在的人很难再获得这种完整的知识图谱了——除非他们也活这么久。  
**Dave Plummer:** Yeah, I kind of came up at a really fortunate time, I think, because I had to come up with the technology over the course of 30 or 40 years, so I understand TTL logic, and I can use AI to write code, and I kind of know all the pieces in between. There certainly are holes in my knowledge, but I think the only way to have got that level of knowledge or the completeness of that picture is to have lived it for that long. And it's going to be hard to duplicate that for people starting now.

**Lex Fridman:** 你觉得这一切的意义是什么？生命、存在……到底是怎么回事？  
**Lex Fridman:** What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing? Of existence of life, whatever is going on here?

**Dave Plummer:** 创造酷炫的东西。对我来说，就是能用自己擅长的方式做出对他人有用的复杂作品。如果让我去搞传统艺术比如绘画雕塑，我肯定束手无策。这就是我的人生意义，当然还包括培养好下一代，把接力棒传下去。  
**Dave Plummer:** Making cool stuff. I guess, fundamentally, what I care about is being able to make complex things that are useful to other people, which leverages my abilities in a way that allows me to be creative and to create things that other people can use in a way that if I was limited to painting or sculpting or whatever in the classic arts, I would be hopeless. And so for me, that's really the meaning of life, and then maybe you raise a couple of good kids to hand the baton off to.

**Lex Fridman:** 你这一生创造的很多东西影响了数百万甚至数十亿人，现在又通过YouTube激发更多人的灵感。无论是过去还是现在，我都是你的忠实粉丝。非常感谢你做的一切，也很高兴今天能和你对话。  
**Lex Fridman:** Yeah, and you've created a lot of cool stuff over your life that impacted millions, probably billions of people, and now you're inspiring… You're creating cool stuff for everyone to see on your YouTube, and you're inspiring people in that way. So for everything you've done in the past and everything you're doing now, I'm a big fan. I'm really grateful for what- … you're doing and grateful that we got a chance to talk today. Thank you, brother.

**Dave Plummer:** 谢谢。  
**Dave Plummer:** Thank you.

**Lex Fridman:** 感谢收听本期对话。支持节目请查看简介中的赞助商信息。最后用C++之父本贾尼·斯特劳斯特鲁普的话作结——顺便说一句，我在很久以前的第48期节目里采访过他。他说："世界上只有两种编程语言：一种被人抱怨，另一种没人使用。"感谢收听，我们下期再见。  
**Lex Fridman:** Thanks for listening to this conversation with Dave Plummer. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave with some words from Bjarne Stroustrup, creator of C++ and somebody who, by the way, I interviewed a long, long time ago, Episode 48 of the podcast. He said, "There are only two kinds of languages. The ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses." Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
